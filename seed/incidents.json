In late November, residents of U.S. Navyâ€™s Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam (JBPHH) on Oahu, Hawaii began reporting fuel-like odors and taste in tap water. The Navy operates its nearby Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility, which has had historic and recent releases of fuel. The Red Hill fuel storage tanks are located 100 feet above a groundwater aquifer that provides a significant portion of the water supply for the Island of Oahu. The Navy has shut down a well in the Red Hill water system after a sample collected there confirmed the presence of fuel-related contaminants. The Hawaii DOH has issued a public advisory that Navy water system consumers not drink or consume tap water. The Honolulu Board of Water Supply has also shut down a well that draws from the same aquifer as the Navys Red Hill well.  Note that the contamination has affected use of water at the NOAA Inouye Regional Center on Ford Island."

Both of the saddle fuel tanks of the semi-truck appear to have been compromised, but it is unknown how much diesel fuel has been spilled. The contents of the trailer are reportedly dairy products, including cartons of milk. No NOAA products were requested, this post is just to keep a record of the incident."

Coastal areas impacted by significant storm surge spanned from Gulf Shores, Alabama east to the Florida panhandle. Seas in excess of 20 feet were observed offshore Pensacola, Florida. USCG Sector Mobile set up incident command for hurricane response operations under their Continuity of Operations Procedure (COOP) at the NOAA Disaster Response Center in Mobile, Alabama.  NOAA disaster response support included deployment of the NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator and Scientific Support Team, as well as the National Geodetic Survey Remote Sensing Division (NGS/RSD) Emergency Response aerial surveillance team, and the Coast Surveyâ€™s mobile navigation response team (NRT).  Additionally, support from NOAA included satellite imagery analysis from the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB) of  National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS).  NOAA's Emergency Response Division and Spatial Data Branch personnel from the Office of Response and Restoration provided direct on-scene support of all pollution response operations including operation of the Common Operational Picture (COP) in NOAA's Environmental Response Management Application (ERMA), as well as data collection and management of all assessment and pollution mitigation for over 1,000 storm-impacted vessels.

A marine pollution surveillance report (MPSR) from NOAA NESDIS noted an anomaly emanating from a structure in Breton Sound #53.  Upon investigation, the discharge was determined to originate at a decommissioned oil production platform previously owned and operated by Century Exploration. The discharge was observed to be active with emulsified oil and silvery sheen beneath the platform, and measured by satellite imagery to be 03 NM x 0.05 NM."

    "description": "On 25-OCT-2017, the USCG Sector San Francisco contacted their NOAA SSC to request trajectory support for an \"old\" grounded tug boat in Half Moon Bay, CA.  The 60-foot long Tug CALEB had been at anchor in Half Moon Bay but dragged anchor during recent heavy wave conditions.  The USCG estimates there may be 3,000-5,000 gallons of mixed oily liquids on board.  As USCG develops a plan to address the vessel, they have requested oil fate & transport support to assess the potential risks to local resources in the event that a spill occurs in the coming weeks."

The FERNSTREAM is one of four potentially polluting shipwrecks described in NOAAâ€™s RULET (Remediation of Underwater Legacy Environmental Threats) risk assessments for the waters off California (USCG District 11).  Because it is not yet clear whether substantial amounts of the shipâ€™s bunkers may remain aboard the FERNSTREAM, a USCG Sector San Francisco-led Taskforce is considering the potential pollution risks of the ship based on initially available data and subsequent investigative efforts.

At the time, she was towing a deck barge with a crane on board and a total of 22,000 gallons of diesel (18,000 on the tug, 4,000 on the barge).  By the time a USCG helicopter was on-scene to conduct search & rescue operations, the barge, a life boat and debris was visible but no signs of pollution and no tug boat.  Four survivors were rescued and taken to shore and the tug is believed sunk and possibly suspended below the barge by a 1,400 foot tow cable.  Water depths in the area are approximately 400 fathoms (2,400 feet), seas are reportedly 14-16 feet and gale force winds.  A second tug boat is due on-scene in the next 14 hours.

    "description": "The Royal Dutch Shell drilling rig Kulluk went aground on Sitkalidak Island, Alaska on January 1, 2013. Sitkalidak is an uninhabitated island just south of Kodiak Island. The Kulluk was being towed from Dutch Harbor to Seattle by the towing vessel Aiviq when it lost engine power, which caused the loss of the Kulluk. Although power was restored to the Aiviq, subsequent attempts at reattaching the tow were not successful, in part due to heavy weather. The Kulluk has on board approximately 144,000 gallons of diesel fuel and 16,000 gallons of lube oils and hydraulic fluid. Currently the Kulluk is sitting upright and there are no observable fuel leaks. The weather continues to remain rough, which is hampering attempts at salvage efforts and site visits.  By Jan. 6 the weather was calmer and salvage crews had stabilized the drilling rig.   As a result the Aiviq, connected by tow, was able to successfully refloat the Kulluk and began towing it to Kliuda Bay, 30 n.m. away.  During the early morning hours of Jan. 7 the Kulluk safely arrived in Kilida Bay and was anchored to its safe harbor assessment position where a thorough evaluation of its condition will be evaluated prior to continuing on to Seattle."

It was originally reported that approximately 500 lbs of the anhydrous ammonia leaked out August 30, however, on September 1 it was discovered that 6000 lbs (this was the full amount on board) of anhydrous ammonia was discharged from the tanks. Approximately 50 lbs of this entered the space it was released in, while the rest drained into the bilge and slowly off gassed. Readings of ammonia in the air were high within the vessel, but were at safe levels outside of the vessel. On scene contractors are following safety precautions. Origninally Sector Puget Sound had requested NOAA's assistance in evaluating response options in terms of atmospheric conditions and plume modeling.

The facility is adjacent to the Mississippi River at mile marker 67, on the right decending bank, and just up river 600 m from the Belle Chasse ferry landing.  Initial safety distances were provided and fate of chemical in the event any entered the reiver were provided. DVB is a highly volatile and ignitable liquid that polymerizes (becomes a plastic like solid) unless stabilized with chemicals to keep it a liquid.  It is insoluble, floats, and will generally evaporate, but may polymerize if it persists.  No DVB had entered the river and was not expected to as of Friday evening, 17Aug. NOAA was contacted in the event it did and for safety issues related to the smoke or vapor plume."

The cause of the sinking was apparently attributed to an excessive internal transfer of sea water to the bow of the vessel causing the vessel to tilt nose-down and sink. All POB were rescued by a Good Sam.  Weather at the time of the sinking was 15 kts SW wind, 3 ft seas.  The CG has asked for a trajectory and possible fate of the diesel. After the sinking, folks on the Good Sam vessel detected a definite odor of diesel. Initial fly overs by ADFG regarding commercial fisheries openings showed some ribbons of sheen.  However by Monday, July 30, no sheen was detectable by the ADFG and CG observers. It is currently uncertain whether all the diesel escaped. Case closed out on August 1, 2012       "

    "description": "Adapted from EPA OSC report:  \"On Monday, July 2, 2012, Michigan DEQ requested EPA assistance at a waterfront property on Portage Canal of Lake Superior in Chassell, Michigan. Two metal flasks suspected to contain mercury were found by swimmers in the Lake approximately 30 feet offshore. The swimmers carried the flasks to the dock at their private residence. The Western Upper Peninsula Health Department (WUPHD) confirmed the presence of mercury in the containers. One container was sealed, but the seal was broken on the second container, resulting in mercury being spilled onto the sandy lakebed as the container was carried to the dock. The resident attempted to recover spilled material visible in the shallow water. The Health Department determined the mercury contamination was limited to the dock area.  OSC <redacted> and <redacted> of MDEQ arrived at the Site late afternoon on July 2, 2012. Due to the prediction of potential thunderstorms in the area overnight, the containers on the dock were overpacked in a plastic sealable tote. The overpack was not relocated in order to minimize potential cross contamination.  EPA and its START and ERRS contractors returned to the Site on July 3, 2012 to conduct an emergency removal action. The contaminated dock area was cleaned to prevent further contamination of the residential property, the gross mercury contamination was removed from the lakebed, the area where the flasks were found was poled to determine if additional containers remain buried in the area, and the mercury waste was removed from the Site. Sediment samples were collected to assess the impact of the spill on the lakebed and determine the need and extent of additional removal activities. USCG and the WUPHD representatives were on-scene during the July 3, 2012 removal activities. MDEQ returned to the Site after EPA, USCG, and WUPHD had demobilized to collect surface water samples.  EPA is planning to remobilize to the Site the week of July 9, 2012 to establish an exclusionary zone around the impacted area and conduct a comprehensive site assessment of the spill area. MDEQ, USCG, and WUPHD are expected to also be on site the week of July 9, 2012.  EPA is acting as the lead agency for this response.\"  EPA OSC contact the NOAA SSC on July 9, 2012 seeking information on the expected trajectory/migration of mercury on the lakebed.

The platform was discharging from their oily water separator when it was discovered that there was a system malfunction and untreated oily water with contamination above permissible ppm was being discharged. This occurred at Ship Shoal 22A, about 35 miles south of Louisiana coast. The sheen is reported as 5.67 miles by 0.5 miles in a combination of 40% silvery sheen, 50% rainbow sheen, and 10% dark sheen. The sheen is considered non-recoverable and is breaking up. This incident occurred at 0600 hrs today. USCG is requesting a trajectory."

    "description": "On July 5, 2012 USCG District 8, Sector NOLA and MSU Morgan City called a conference call to discuss an alleged use of actual dispersant during a planned MSRC drill on June 12 & 13, 2012.  MSRC aerial dispersant contactor was scheduled to do a test spray using tap water only in a target area 50mi SE of Stennis airport (thier base of operations).  Instead, the test sprays were conducted over Chandeleur Sound jsut east of the Miss R. delta, in an area being worked by a fleet of \"pogie boats\" (small fish netting) with a spotter aircraft directing the pogie boats. During the incident, the spotter aircraft is reported to have taken a set of pictures of the area showing teh water covered by a large area of foam.  No exact coordinates or other record of the image time/date/ and location were provided to the USCG.  In a news article published 4July2012 on the Times-Picayune web site (NOLA.com), it was alledged that Placquemines Parish was not informed of the drill.  Additionally, it is alledged by Parish President Billy Nungesser that real dispersant was being sprayed since fishermen in the area who had observed the spray aircraft said the water was foamy and their skin itched.  During the USCG call, which included the NOLA SSC, assistent SSC, and Charlie Henry, the source of the foam in the photos was discussed.  The NOAA team's initial estimate of the source of the foam is that it is the result of natural process, including the high winds obvious in the images, and possibly the presence of an algal bloom.  The NOAA team is investigating the potential foaming source with scientists familiar with the local and algal blooms.  This hotline is being established to capture information for future use."

    "description": "BACKGROUND: On Tuesday, 05 JUN, at approx 12:45pm, Coast Guard Sector Baltimore was notified of a barge splitting in half in the fish market area of Southwest DC (Washington Channel) with oil in the water.  At that time, Sector Baltimore filed an NRC report and dispatched a pollution response team.  DC Fire Dept was already o/s and successfully contained the spill with approx 600ft of harbor boom.  The \"barge\" is actually a permanently moored floating structure/storefront used to sell fish.  The rear section of the structure collapsed, sending two fuel storage tanks into the water, each containing approx 150-200 gals of diesel fuel.  Moderate media interest occurred with local DC radio and the Associated Press contacting the Coast Guard for more information.  CG D5 PADET issued a press release Tuesday afternoon.  No wildlife was reported to be affected.  HEPACO was hired by the responsible party (a private citizen) to clean up the spill.  The spill response continued through Tuesday night, though hampered by darkness and a large amount of oiled debris (wood planks, etc.) in the water from the structure collapse.  DC Dept of the Environment was notified and sent inspectors to the scene.  Clean-up efforts continued through the day on Wednesday; however, late morning on Wednesday, HEPACO expressed concerns about the r/p's ability to pay.  At that point, the USCG assumed federal responsibility for the clean-up efforts and accessed the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for $50,000.  HEPACO was hired was issued an ATP of $30,000.  June 6, 2012 UPDATE: Spill response continued through the night last night and continues this morning.  Both fuel tanks have been removed along with 95% of the oiled debris and recoverable product.  USCG anticipates reaching an endpoint sometime later today or tomorrow.  USCG Sector Baltimore's Mobile Command Post trailer is on scene and will remain on scene with Sector Baltimore personnel until the response is complete.  There have been no reports of injury to wildlife and no claims of oiled vessels made to the Coast Guard at this time."

On Sunday, May 14, the Deep Sea unexpectedly sank with an unknown amount of diesel fuel on board.  Oil skimming vessels placed oil containment boom around the area of the sunken vessel. The Coast Guard hired Ballard Diving & Salvage Co. to plug vents and seal the vesselâ€™s fuel tanks.  However, a cracked vent allowed fuel to leak from the sunken vessel at an estimated rate of 2 gallons per minute.   On May 14, some commercial shellfish operations in Penn Cove voluntarily stopped harvesting on before fuel reached nearby mussel rafts.  The volume of diesel spilled from the boat grew through Monday, leaving a very thin coating of oil over the commercial operation, leading the Washington Department of Health to close the area. Recreational shellfish harvesting in Penn Cove was also temporarily closed.  The oil sheen was too thin to remove from the water.  Ecology has been monitoring shoreline areas for potential environmental effects from the spill. Some sheen had reached the shore in places. Ecology is analyzing water samples collected help evaluate environmental impacts from the spill.  There have been no injured or killed mammals or fish observed or reported.  The Washington Department of Natural Resources is developing options for salvaging the vessel.  The Coast Guard has opened the federal Oil Spill Liability Fund to pay for response efforts.   NOAA ERD has been requested to create trajectories for potential releases during salvage operations and to assist the WA State Department of Health in connecting to NOAA's Seafood Inspection Program for sensory testing."

The vessel was 1100 nm from Honolulu en route to China from Panama and was not intending to come to Hawaii, but notified the USCG in case it needed to make an emergency call. NOAA ERD was asked for information about Direct Reduced Iron.  Based on subsequent information and technical analysis provided to the USCG from the shipper, the situation stabilized.  The temperatures, which had been approximately 15 degrees centigrade above normal at the time of initial notification, ceased increasing and began decreasing slowly.  The shipper reported that it considered this temperature fluctuation normal behavior for this cargo. The vessel did not come into Hawaii."

The substance leaked into nearby waters, and has contaminated the ship. NOAA has been asked to advise on toxicity levels as it pertains to response crew safety. Clean-up contractors have been called."

The vessel crew has reported to the CG that there is some type of steering casualty and that the crew was not able to make repairs while they were underway.     Shortly, thereafter, CG Sector Anchorage requested the SSC to initiate a SPOT weather forecast from the NWS.   No spill has occurred.  The vessel is a 656 ft long  Singapore registered vessel with 23 crew members aboard.  The USCG reports that the vessel's cargo is packaged lumber and that there are 227,000 gallons of bunker C oil and 60,000 gallons of diesel on board.  As of Dec. 6, the vessel was drifting in a northwest direction away from land and is projected to continue to drift to the north for the next day.   After flying in some Norwegian engineers - to Anchorage, Adak, and then via CG helo to the MV Morning Cedar - temporary repairs were accomplished on the rudder.   This allowed the vessel a modicum of steerage, by using the bow thruster in conjunction with main engine and fixed rudder, to control the vessel and motor at a higher speed.  Hence, the CG ordered the vessel to motor to Dutch Harbor, where it arrived on Sun. morning, Dec. 11, 2011, to make permanent  vessel steerage repairs.  The tug Guardsmen as well as the CGC Sherman will stand by until the CG has fully inspected and approved these repairs.  Case Closed John Whitney, NOAA Alaska SSC"

    "description": "On the morning of Aug 31st, a construction vehicle struck a high pressure oil transfer line at the Capital Terminal in East Providence, RI while a barge was off-loading and created a geyser of oil that first sprayed approximately a 1 acre area and then, once the valves were closed (5-6 minutes), leaked onto the ground.  The estimated aerial release was approximately 40-50 thousand gallons of diesel fuel and the remaining flow is yet to be determined, but could bring the total to over 100K.  Virtually the entire release is confined to the land, either in the spray area or in a quickly constructed dike area.  Only minor sheens have been reported in the Seekonk River.  Gross oil recovery is nearly complete and gauging is in progress to determine the amount released.  Assessments are in progress o determine the amount of oil remaining in the soil on top of the water table.  NOAA is assisting in estimating the evaporation amounts and ultimately the mass balance so that the amount remaining in the nearby soil can be approximated."

    "description": "On June 26, 2011, the NOAA Duty Officer was notified of the sinking of the 68-foot tugboat Aries in the Bering Sea approximately 95 miles east of St. Paul Island.  St Paul is one of the Pribilof Islands, and is about 750 miles west of Anchorage.  All 4 crew members were rescued.  The Tug is sunken in about 300 feet of water, and there is a potential of 29,000 gallons of diesel.  A sheen was reported on the surface. On Monday, June 27, USCG requested a trajectory for the fuel oil believed to be leaking from the vessel.  Rate is unknown at this time. The tug was towing a barge carrying a mobile home and construction equipment. The barge was anchored to keep it from drifting. Another tug is en route and expected to arrive this afternoon.  At the sunken tug location of approximately 100 nm ESE of St. Paul and about 100 meters water depth, considerable concern was expressed by NMFS regarding the possible oiling of some of the thousands of foraging fur seals which habitat this area, from escaping diesel, even though a very large diesel release as the tug was actually documented by the crewmen from the tug after escaping onto the barge.         On several occasions the RP very diligently attempted various modes, both by vessel and by air, to monitoring the occurrence of sheen on the surface nothing was ever noted.   The combination of heavy weather and human safety concerns, led to a halt of these efforts and to the assumption that it was likely that the entire diesel contents of the tug had been relesased.    .

The size of slick is reported as â€œseveral milesâ€ in length.  The initial information is sketchy, and the USCG has launched a helicopter and small boat to investigate as well as coordinating with the USFWS Breton Wildlife Refuge Manager.  No responsible party is yet known.  NOAA was requested to provide an Initial Trajectory Analysis and Resources at Risk analysis.  In 2005, this same refuge was impacted by a small spill resulting in the death of more than 600 pelican.  USFWS reports that there are nearly 7000 pelican on North Breton Island currently and this is nesting season."

The vessel is 50ft in length and is carrying 100 gallons of gasoline.  USCG Sector New York contacted NOAA Duty Officer to report incident. Vessel had grounded on NPS lands in an area currently closed to the public due to on-going piping plover, oyster catcher, and tern nesting activities. Owner of vessel is in the process of making arrangements with Sea Tow to remove on-board gasoline this afternoon during low-tide.  An attempt to tow the vessel off the beach will be made after the fuel has been removed.  If effort to remove vessel is unsucessful, vessel will have to remain grounded until September which is the end of bird nexting season.  "

    "description": "This is a potential spill. The F/V Norâ€™Quest lost anchor on the evening of May 24, 2011 and started to drift ashore towards the Hagemeister Island. The vessel captain notified the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) at 3:15  AM on May 25, 2011. Located within Hagemeister Strait within Bristol Bay and approximately 15 miles S/W of Togiak, Alaska. Lat/Long: 58Âº44.700N, 160Âº52.900W. The vessel captain estimates that 16,800 â€“ 18,800 gallons of diesel fuel, 200 gallons of gasoline, 200 gallons of lube oil, 300 gallons of hydraulic oil, and 110 gallons of waste oil are on board the vessel. USCG has conducted an overflight with a C-130 and reported no visible sheen in the area. In addition the USCG contacted the USCG Pacific Strike Team for possible lightering support. The F/V Norâ€™Quest was unable to remove itself from the grounding location on this morningâ€™s high tide. A second vessel owned by SRW Marine Services attempted to attach a tow line to the vessel but was unable to safely approach close enough. USCG has requested that the vessel operator develop a fuel removal plan and a vessel salvage plan.. Alaska Chadux Corporation, a spill response contractor, has also been notified and has been asked to stand by to assist with any sensitive area protection and spill cleanup if necessary.  Vessel crew is attempting to cap the vessel fuel vents. On 29May at 2330 lightering ops commenced, and a total of 9,000 gallons of diesel was lightered off for a total of 12,000 gallons. 15 barrels of misc oils and 200 gallons of gasoline were removed from deck. Vessel was successfully refloated on 30May at 0430. Magone's divers have departed the scene. Intentions are to tow the vessel 3 miles off of Togiak Island to Nunavochak to anchor. A tow plan is to be submitted and upon plan approval and adequate weather conditions, the Nor'quest will be towed to Dutch Harbor. USCG personnel that was O/S is to arrive in Dillingham at 1700 30May, and both USCG members to return to Anchorage at 1530 on 01Jun"

    "description": "RRT6 Activation Issue: Mississippi Flooding and Opening of Morganza Waterway Could impact Facilities in the Atchafalaya River and Basin.  USACE expects to be forced into opening the Morganza Floodway to help mitigate the threat of floodwaters on the Mississippi River on or about 13 May 2011 (possibly even sooner). This will represent the first opening of the Morganza Floodgates since the 1973 Flood and will move flood waters into flood prone areas west of the river.  Rainfall and spring flooding in the Ohio River Valley has the Mississippi River running very high and this situation is expected to persist for at least two weeks.  Flood gates on the Bonnet Carre Spillway structure in St. Charles Parish Louisiana will be opened starting today (Monday) to release water from the Mississippi River into the Lake Pontchartrain area to reduce the amount of water reaching New Orleans. The USACE will be (or likely has by now) asking the Mississippi River Commission for permission to open the Morganza Spillway structure. Opening the Morganza floodgates will release water into the Atchafalaya River and Atchafalaya Basin or spillway, which includes parts of St. Landry, St. Martin, Iberia and St. Mary parishes in the Acadiana area. Some communities, homes and businesses inside the spillway levees should start preparing now to evacuate if the Morganza is opened is the message being released. The threat is real, and with this threat there is the threat of possible pollution events.   RRT6 has been activated and is coordinating with the State of Louisiana and the RRT6 Federal Partners as to what threat this may have on facilities that include oil refineries located on the Atchafalaya River and oil production facilities in the basin.  NOAAâ€™s Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R) as part of the Regional Response Team and as part of other regional coordination activities is monitoring the situation.

His ETA on scene is estimated to be Monday evening, March 7.  The Coast Guard requested that NOAA keep them abreast of the weather throughout this incident.   At the time of the grounding, the weather was small craft advisories with NE winds, 30 kt, seas 10 feet.   A Coast Guard overflight is slated for Monday afternoon, March 7.  On Thursday, March 10, 2011, salvors completed removal of all recoverable petroleum products from the vessel. They estimate that they removed approximately 1,200 gallons of fuel and oils from the vessel. A more precise volume will be determined when the fluids are offloaded in Dutch Harbor.  No impacts to wildlife have been reported. No impacts to historic or cultural resources have been identified at this time. Commercial fisheries operating in the area should not be affected and no closures have been initiated."

    "description": "On Monday January 31, 2011, The NOAA SSC covering District 8 was notified of recent reports of unknown bright orange-pink substances in and around Panama City, FL.  On January 27th USCG unit Panama City, FL investigated the report of an orange-pink substance floating in St. Andrews Marina, near Panama City, FL.  The substance had no oily smell and in addition to floating, some of the material was present below the surface. It was also noted to be phosphorescent.  A sample was taken but not sent off to be analysed for oil.  On Sunday, January 30th, USCG received reports and photos of a similar material offshore of Panama City 6, 10 and 12 miles.  Based on the description, the NOAA SSC suspected an algal bloom, which has since been confirmed as Noctiluca scintillans, a non-photosynthetic, bioluminescent, and generally non-toxic algae that commonly blooms at this time of year, as well as other seasons.  This hotline report is being opened to capture the information for reference and in the event responders to the DWH Gulf Oil Spill receive inquiries on if the event is related to it. On February 18, additional reports of algal blooms have been coming into USCG and Florida Wildlife Commission (FWC) all across the FL Panhandle. FWC's Harmfull Algal Bloom team is monitoring the situation."

Pepco employees notified the Coast Guard Sunday at 12:40 p.m., reporting approximately 5,000 gallons of mineral oil was believed to have leaked from a transformer at the Pepco substation in Alexandria. It was also reported, that an additional 500 gallons had leaked into the Potomac River.  Coast Guard Sector Baltimoreâ€™s Incident Management Division personnel arrived on scene at approximately 2 p.m. Sunday and conducted a shoreline assessment of the area.  Triumvirate Environmental and Clean Harbors have been hired by Pepco to contain and dispose of the oil. The oil that reached the waterway has been contained by boom.  The cause of the spill is under investigation.  USCG Sector Baltimore contacted NOAA SSC early evening on Tuesday, Jan. 25.  USCG reported that mineral oil was not dispersing and requested information from NOAA about toxicity concerns if any, and rate of dispersion.  Chris Barker, Robert Jones, and Gary Shigenaka provided support."

A report from BOEMRE confirms that an oil slick has been reported at that location, so confidence is high.  USCG Sector NOLA/Morgan City have been provided this information, weather, and an initial trajectory analysis. The initial trajectory indicates that winds and currents should keep the oil offshore so that it is not expected to be a threat to land at least throught the coming weekend.

A small quantity of diesel was released from the day tank causing a small sheen.   The vessel contained approximately 1200 gallons of diesel fuel.   The barge was under contract to Pioneer Natural Resources Co. who immediately called in Alaska Clean Seas, their OSRO for the North Slope.   ACS responded and close all the tank valves.  On the morning overflight on Sept. 15 no sheen was observed.   The vessel was judged to be in stable condition and awaited salvors to refloat and reattach the barge.   and tug.  No assistance from NOAA was requested.   Weather was mild with 15-20 knot winds from east.  Prior to reattaching the tug to the barge, as much diesel as possible was lightered from the tug.  The remaining fuel had to await leveling and reattachment.   The combo was then towed to the Oliktok Point deck for final inspection.  "

The Princess Kathleen ran aground on Pt Lena just outside Juneau and then sank just off the point with an unknown quantity of Fuel oil in her tanks.  From a time shortly after her sinking to today, she has been leaking fuel oil into the surrounding waters.   Recent increases in the sightings of small oil blobs in the area of Lena Pt. resulted in Sector Juneau's decision to seriously evaluate the wreck for possible removal of the remaining fuel, which is very roughly estimated at 155,000 gallons of bunker C.  On Feb. 16, 2010, Global Offshore Divers of Anchorage mobilized a three-man remote operated vehicle crew to Juneau in response to a request by the USCG, Sector Juneau's Incident management, to survey the wreck of this vessel.   The survey lasted a total of three days from Feb. 17-19 with two ROV's, and the first entry in this Hotline is the Global Diving report from those surveys.    After mobilization of equipment from Seattle, Global Diving tentatively hopes to start pumping oil on or about March 5.  NOAA has been asked to provide weather and trajectory support for this incident. All operations progressed methodically, and hence most of the fuel was successfully removed."

Fuel was being transferred from a tanker at the adjacent loading dock, when overflow of the tank occurred discharging the diesel into an adjacent oil/water separator.  This unit was also overwhelmed and  the fuel entered Helmet Creek which flows into the small boat harbor portion of Sweeper Cove.  Initially, two areas of hard boom with sorbent boom were placed along the creek and a vac truck was deployed at the oil/water separator.  As of the morning of Jan. 12, it is believed that the vast majority of the diesel was confined to or collected in the stream, and only an estimated 1000 gallons had entered the small boat harbor.   Apparently conditions are fairly calm in Sweeper Cove.   The Coast Guard is planning on chartering a flight out to Adak to ascertain the situation.   Current weather at Adak Island is NW winds at 30 kts, seas 9 feet; however, Sweeper Cove is in the wind shadow on the eastern side of the island. The SOSC requeste that the NOAA SSC join with Bob Petit from ADEC to conduct a SCAT survey of the entire length of Helmet Creek along which most of the oil traveled enroute Sweeper Cove and the small boat harbor.   That SCAT survey report is appended. Due to the variety of fauna associated with Sweeper Cove and Helmet Crk, all the trustees decided to conduct a NRDA survey.

The vessel's starboard bow was reported as aground.    While CG was establishing an IC and activated salvage teams the the vessel was able to free herself by transferring ballast and bunker fuel aft.  Three tugs were also on hand to assist.  CG reported the vessel was free 0812EST.   We have a NOAA contractor enroute to catch up with the CG investigators as well as to do an initial reef survey."

By 6:30 a.m. Friday, the vessel grounded about a quarter mile from the Little Island Park Pier.  The 570-foot barge carries various chemicals that the Coast Guard considers hazardous material.  84 HAZMAT loads, containing products such as syrup for soft drinks, alcohol, empty cylinders formerly containing water purification chemicals, and chlorine, etc. are on board, according to ship's owner Crowley Puerto Rico Service, Inc.  As of November 13,  Titan Salvage has been engaged and a salvage master is on site.  A naval architect and assistant salvage master are en route and removal plans are being developed.  Officials expect improving weather conditions to enhance salvage and removal efforts.  The barge left San Juan, Puerto Rico on November 6 and was headed to Pennsauken, New Jersey (in the Philadelphia area).

A trajectory and weather information were  requested.   On Saturday, Oct. 31, a CG helo overflight found the vessel grounded on Egg Island, on the west side of Unalaska Island, but still capsized and with a small sheen move westerly from the vessel.   Dan Magone was hired as a salvor to attempt to tow the vessel to a place of refuge for stabilization and fuel removal and ultimately to Dutch Harbor for salvage and repairs.   On Sunday at 1500 while towing the Carley Renee only a few miles west of Egg Island, the vessel suddenly sank supposedly in 125 fathoms of water with no sheen on the water surface.

Divers have reported sheens coming from the Coimbra for decades,  but the article suggests that the leakage may be getting worse.  Last Thursday, the USCG contacted Ed Levine,  NOAA SSC for the region,  to discuss the situation.  It is expected that an interagency conference call will be held this week to determine whether an investigation to evaluate response options,  is warranted.  At the national level,  ERD is developing an interagency agreement with the USCG under which the agencies will work together to address threats from vessels sunken off US shores that contain significant volumes of oil.

    "description": "Crowley Barge 160-1 ran aground near Quinhagak, AK, just south of the mouth of the Kuskokwim River on Sept. 16, 2009, as the result of navigation error during a normal fuel delivery to the village of Quinhagak.   The barge has 72,000 gallons of gasoline and 72,000 gallons of Jet fuel.  The barge is a 1968 single skin barge.   The grounded barge had gone through two tidal cycles, during which the tug could not pull it off the bottom, prior to notifying CG Sector Anchorage on Sept. 17.    No fuel has been released into the the environment.    The CG requested that the NOAA SSC provide weather and tidal information.      Shortly after the grounding a second barge, the OB-5, was summoned from Bethel 80 miles to the north.   Barge OB-5 was able to liter 60,000 gallons of Jet fuel from barge 160-1 and delivered 55,000 gallons to tanks at Quinhagak.   Upon returning to 160-1, barge OB-5 itself grounded just west of the location of the 160-1.   When OB-5 refloated on a subsequent high tide, it was directed to stand by offshore as it had too much draft to conduct further work in the mouth of the Kanektok River.     Crowley summoned another barge from Nome to complete the litering of the still grounded 160-1.       The combination of a spring tide and a strong westerly wind produced enough water under the barge to refloat it spontaneously very early on Sept. 22.    The barge was towed to the Quinhagak tank farm where it transferred all its remaining cargo with the exception of 5000 gallons of jet fuel.    It subsequently was directed to Bethel where it will be inspected by the Coast Guard.    Thus bringing an end to the incident.          "

Based on NE currents (1-2 knots) and SW winds (5-7 knots) the sheen was moving in a NE direction away from shore.  Based on 80 degree water temps and 90 degrees air temps, SSC expected sheen to dissipate within 12-24 hours depending upon rate of discharge of diesel fuel from fuel tanks. Sailboat involved in incident was secured and towed to shore.  A vessel is enroute to salvage the F/V TINA RAY which sank.  "

    "description": "USCG D13 contacted the SSC to request assistance identifying potential source locations for two mystery sheens observed on July 5, 2009 in Honolulu Harbor, Oahu.  The first report was made at 0610 of an unknown sheen IVO Piers 21 and 22, Honolulu Harbor. The oil was reported to be a non-dyed product with a slight diesel odor. The second sheen was reported at 0737 near the CGC RUSH at Pier 53 on Sand Island. The oil was reported to be a red-dyed product.   The USCG Pollution Investigator estimated the first sheen to be about 5 gallons of product and the second sheen to be approximately 20 to 30 gallons of product. PENCO was hired to recover oil near Pier 53 at Sand Island. Cleanup was completed by 1400 July 5.   USCG D14 has requested NOAA SSC assistance with weather (tides, currents, wind) for the area for the period of late Saturday night (4 July) through Monday morning (6 July) and help in possibly identifying where the spill may have originated."

The assessment of the vessel's condition and fuel load is being conducted in preparation for potentially pumping off the remaining fuel later this year. The USS Chehalis reportedly has been periodically releasing small amounts of oil ever since it sank in Pago Pago Harbor in 1949.  The salvage assessment in being conducted by US Navy Supervisor of Salvage and Diving and the Navy Mobile Underwater Diving Salvage Unit out of Honolulu, with logistical support from the US Coast Guard Pacific Strike Team, the US Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment in American Samoa, US Coast Guard Sector Honolulu, and US Coast Guard District 14. The assessment activities are scheduled to occur from April 23 through May 9, 2009. A previous assessment conducted by American Samoa Environmental Protection Agency indicated that the fuel remaining aboard the vessel includes 40,000 gallons of motor gasoline (\"Mogas\"), 70,000 gallons of aviation gasoline (\"Avgas\") and 5000 gallons of marine diesel. There is also ammunition aboard.  "

Location of the spill was at the \"Shrimp Docks\" on the southwest side of the 22nd St. Causeway.  The majority of the spill was apparently contained in the immediate vicinity of the dockside facility by the responsible party, since they are also an oil spill cleanup contractor whose HQ is at the dock where the oil was discharged.  The collision opened a 2 foot long gash in the port forward quarter of the barge, puncturing one of the barges tanks.  It is a single skin barge.  NOAA ERD was apparently not notified, and the SSC learned of it through ARD personnel at 1850 local, 1Apr09, although the earliest reports indicated the spill was less than 1000 gallons and contained.  A site visit on 2Apr09 by the SSCr in St. Petersburg collected further information."

    "description": "Redoubt Volcano, intermittently active since January and approximately 100 nm SW of Anchorage on the west side of Cook Inlet, resumed its activity late Sunday night and  early Monday morning, March 22 & 23, with five explosive eruptions.  These eruptions caused lahars, extensive fllooding, and mud flows around the Drift River Tank Farm, where oil from the Cook Inlet fields is temporarily stored prior to shipping out aboard tankers.    Currently, two of the four active tanks have 74,000 bbls of oil apiece. At 7:30 PM on March 23rd, ADEC and USCG conducted an over-flight to determine any potential threat to the tank farm and related facilities at the Drift River Terminal.  They observed extensive flooding to the area with mud flows to a depth of six feet in the area of the runway and ballast tank, but no significant penetration of the 18 to 20 foot high teritiary containment berm around the tank farm.  No oil or hazardous substance releases have been reported at this time.  Cook Inlet Pipeline Company, operator of the tank farm, is planning on-the-ground evaluation today of the teritiary berms, pumps, and other equipment and facilities necessary for the operation of the tank farm.   The Alaska Volcano Observatory is predicting additional explosive activity of the volcano in the near future, which combined with the extensive amount of snow and ice on the flanks of Redoubt could cause additional significant flooding and mud flows towards the Drift River Tank Farm.    The Coast Guard has asked the NOAA SSC to keep fully abreast of the situation and to participate in conference calls among the CG, the state, the tank farm operator and others.          The last  major explosive eruption of Redoubt volcano occurred on April 4.  It was the largest eruption, during this sequence,  and produced the largest lahar to date, completely encircling the Drift River Tank Farm (DRTF).    None of the mud or water, however, penetrated the large dikes around the facility.   As an additional safety precaution, Chevron and Cook Inlet Pipeline decided to completely shut in the  DRTF and proceeded to draw down the oil in the two active storage tanks to minimal levels.    To achieve greater tank stability, 30,000 Bbls of fresh water was added to each of the two active tanks.         With no eruptions since April 4 and dome building in the volcano's throat dramatically decreasing, the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) decided to downgrade the threat level of the volcano from orange to yellow on June 29, 2009.

Five POB and the vessel had 15,000 gallons of diesel and grounded in 18 to 25 ft. of water.   At the moment the Coast Guard is treating the incident strictly as a SAR case, although NOAA SSC and Sector Anchorage personnel are gearing up to treat this as a pollution case, and have called for a UC meeting morning of March 5.  NOAA is providing weather, tides, ADIOS runs, and possible trajectories and impacts.  Dan Magone from Dutch Harbor was hired as the vessel salvor to extricate it from its rocky grounding on the shoreline on the N. side of St. George Island.   After several fits and starts, bad weather, labor difficulties, broken equipment,etc, etc. the vessel was finally refloated around the first of May and was taken to Dutch Harbor for final repairs.   No significant amounts of oil were released during the incident. "

Conditions were horrific with  sustained winds of 60 to 70 kts and  gusts approaching 100 kts.   Vessel was intentionally beached on a rocky shoreline shadowed by a high vertical cliff face.  The 4 POB were rescued by Coast Guard helo, and the status of the fuel onboard is unknown at this time.Initially, from an overflight, no pollution was reported, and the vessel appeared to be in good condition.  However on up close examination, the bottom of the vessel was found to be badly damaged causing a release of all the diesel and all the hydralic oil.   The 200 gallons of lube oil was removed.    NOAA SSC  provided weather forecast support throughout as well as information on the fate of the oil if a release occurred.   The state of Alaska will managed both the disposal of the Pacific cod and the vessel."

The location is approximately a half a mile south of Honolulu Airport's Reef Runway and a mile and a half from the entrance of Pearl Harbor. No oil has been released at this time. The vessel is taking on water, however, the water is contained in the space adjacent to the sonar array. It is believed that only the sonar array is aground. Operations to free the vessel, reportedly grounded on sand and crushed coral rock, are in progress. The vessel is reported to be carrying 250,000 gallons of navy marine diesel and 1000 gallons of JP5 aboard."

The release came from a storage tank that had a faulty check valve on a pump. Approximately 6,000 gallons of oil leaked into the secondary containment. Of that, an estimated half made its way into the CT River through a storm drain. The release may have started over a week ago and was not noticed until today. The operator noticed that they went through about a months worth of oil in 10 days. That's when they went to inspect the tank and discovered the oil pool. There is snow covering the ground and the river is frozen solid. The USCG requested trajectory information and recommendations on oil under ice response actions."

The spill occurred in remote area and the surrounding are is heavily wooded making access to the spill site difficult.  VADEQ is on-scene and overseeing response activities.  A vac truck is on-scene and is stationed just south of the spill site attempting to recover the fuel.  According to on-scene VADEQ personnel, there is a section of stream below where the spill took place but above where the vac truck is located with a relatively heavy concentration of floating deisel fuel.  SSC made recommendations to initiate flushing above the spill site in order to expedite movement of product downstream to area where vac truck is working.  SSC also recommended that sorbents be placed alonmg the shoreline where accessible and if available, placement of boom to use to deflect free floating product toward vac truck. No further support requested.  VADEQ contacts Mark Miller 866-640-0883 John Geise 804-698-4287 "

The vessel has about 38,000 gallons of diesel onboard, is currently listing at around 30 degrees, and has been successfully abandoned. In addition, the Granite Pt. platform has been shut-in and abandoned, as the result of concern for possible damage to the platform.  It appears that SSC may be headed on-scene.    The CG and the SSC headed on-scene via a CG C-130 which overflew the Granite Pt. platform and the overturned Monarch hull just barely showing above the surface of the water. A couple of hours later it was reported that the Monarch had sunk to the seafloor in rougly 80 to 90 feet of water.    Due to the ice and strong currents, it was decided to attempt a salvage operation in the spring.     However, in March it was announced that the Monarch would be left on the bottom of Cook Inlet adjacent to the Granite Pt. platform."

The vessel had 650 gallons of diesel fuel in tanks and 4 drums of diesel on board.  After grounding, the 2-man crew abandoned the vessel and was rescued by the CG and taken to Chignik.   Aghiyuk Island is part of the Alaska Maritime NWR.   The CG requested weather and possible oil fate should any release occur.    Due to bad weather an initial CG overflight was unable to obtain any clear view or photos of the vessels.    In order to assess the condition and situation of the vessel, the CG hired Magone Marine out of Dutch Harbor.   Due to distance, however, their ETA was some time on Jan. 8.    Over the next several weeks, bad weather hampered Magone's efforts to get on-scene, and he was successful only a couple of times, until finally it was confirmed that the vessel had sunk.  "

A half inch nipple between the casing valve and check valve broke from an oil producing well resulting in oil flowing free from the wellhead.  The source was secured at 0127 hrs (local time).  The discharged amount is unknown, but suspected to be small since the well only produces 4 to 5 bbls per day."

Total sheen size was 5 miles by 5 miles with a concentrated sheen in the center of dark gold bands with light gold centers approximately 1 1/2 mile by 1 mile. Bubbling broke surface of the water slightly. Sheen was moving northwest and the weather was cloudy with possible rain and a sea of 5ft. Location of the sheen was N28 40.84 and W91 12.64. There was a red buoy approximately 100 ft from the bubbling and a helo deck approximately 400 ft from the bubbling as well. As of this time there is no RP who has come forward or been located. Discharge was first located at 1350 15SEP08. Sheen is approximately 52 miles off shore. Discharge is ongoing at this time and has not been secured. "

The double-hulled barge was intentionally grounded (on a soft, sandy bottom) for the delivery of the fuel; however, it grounded too high on the beach to re-float.  There has been no spillage of any product and the likelihood of a release is considered small, but a hotline has been opened as a precaution. The owner is preparing a \"salvage\" plan, which will likely include off-loading a portion of the fuel onto another barge on Saturday.

No discharge was reported when Sector Juneau was notified at 0744 on July 7.   NOAA is currently providing tides and weather information to the Coast Guard along with a preliminary written trajectory.   The vessel refloated on the afternoon rising tide.  No compromise occurred to the hull or fuel tanks, although there was some minor internal structural damage.  The vessel will be headed to dry dock for a complete examination and repair, as needed.       "

NSTAR and environmental response contractor Clean Harbors are on-scene addressing released oil in Muddy River.   Source of release is an undergound conduit containing high voltage electrical line and insulated with mineral oil (cable oil).  Cause of the release is still under investigation. Initial estimated quantity of 5000 gallons appears to be accurate.   Release is secured with containment and recovery operations ongoing at locations along the Muddy River.   An estimated 1000-2000 gallons may reach the Charles River. NSTAR/Clean Harbor have deployed assets to contain and recover the release if it reaches the Charles River.  -------------------- SSC Report:      SSC was contacted at 1230 EDT by Sector Boston with concerns relative to the release, even though it was some distance from the coastal zone.  They wanted to both be prepared to respond and to provide assistance to the EPA OSC, if such assistance were to become necessary.  NOAA/ERD chemist and senior life scientist were consulted.  Toxicity and potential for actionable impacts to the marine environment were deemed low due to the nature of the product (Luminol Type-2, a Petro-Canada product).  SSC reported to Sector Boston and briefed the key response personnel.  No further action from the USCG or NOAA is anticipated.  No further request for assistance from EPA is expected.

NOAA ERD was contacted regarding advice on vessel wreck removal alternatives and trade-offs. Further destruction to the reef environment is a serious concern. The vessel is approximately 70 foot-long of wooden construction.  The vessel has a large hole in the keel and is firmly lodged on the reef flat.  Floating the vessel and removing it may be difficult due to the hole in the keel and the degradation of the ship's supporting structure.  Land based access to the site is limited to a private road and it will be difficult to bring in heavy equipment.  "

The tank has been leaking for at least 6 hours and is ongoing.  The spilled material is currently contained within the facility but is creating hazardous fumes.  The river has been closed to traffic for a mile above and below the facility.   NOAA ERD has been requested to evaluate the migration of the fumes, potential response options to minimize fumes, and potential impacts and fates if the spilled acid is released into the river.  On 17 March 2008, 430,000 gallons of this acid solution was discharged into the Mississippi River.  Two weeks later, additional leaks were detected at the facility.  The response continues as a managed emergency to remove this product safely from the facility at the direction of the USCG.  NOAA continues to provide scientific support as requested."

Storm Chasers, a local OSRO, was hired to clean up the spill.  The release estimates are 250 to 1000 gallons of diesel.   Several folks from Sector Anchorage dispatched to Seward to attend to the spill.    Sector Anchorage requested verbal trajectory, weather, tidal state, and ADIOS weathering curve.   Upon arrival the Coast Guard immediately released that the actual release was considerably less than the initial estimate.   In fact, by Thursday morning, Feb. 21, only minimal sheening was observed.    After gauging the tank that the diesel had leaked from, the amount of the release was set at less than 68 gallons of diesel.   "

A CG  helo conducted an overflight of the stricken vessel at approximately 8:50 a.m.and reported a 2.5 nautical mile long sheen coming off the vessel.   The helo crew also reported the containment boom transported to the scene had been deployed.   Meanwhile, the CG contracted with SEAPRO for site assessment and the SEAPRO oil spill response vessel M/V Rudyard Bay departed Ketchikan at 7:30 a.m.  but did not arrive on-scene until night fall of that day.   By early afternoon on Feb. 17, the owner of the vessel reported all the vents on the vessel's oil tanks were successfully plugged during the afternoon low tide.  A second CG overflight conducted during the morning of Feb. 18 reported only sheen on the water.   Being a Sunday followed by a holiday, the CG was unable to roust any potential salvors and/or divers who could sound the fuel tanks, although the CG is currently working to develop salvage and lightering plans.   The capacity of the vessel is 4000 gallons of diesel in four tanks, 150 gallons of lube oil and 150 gallons of hydraulic oil; however, at this time the amount of fuel remaining in the tanks is unknown.    No sensitive resources were identified by the CG within 45 miles of the grounding site.  Salvor and marine surveyor finally hired to deal with the situation.   In the interim the M/V Rudyard Bay had pumped out over 4000 gals of diesel, and the marine surveyor reported no visible signs of oil in the engine room and some residual bilge slop oil in the forward compartment.   Attention is now directed at removing and disposing the 130 tons of bait herring that was on board the vessel.   "

    "description": "A malfunction at the General Services Administration heating plant at 13th and C Streets resulted in an oil spill. Heating fuel oil was in the process of being transferred from a day tank to a second tank when it was over filled.  Oil flowed into a storm drain and then into the Potomac River adjacent to Maine Street.  Majority of oil was contained via booming along the floating fish  markets along Maine Street in Washington Marina.  GSA contracted with Miller Marine to clean up spill. Sector Baltimore, Washington DC DEQ on-scene. Boom was deployed at appropriate areas in and around Washigton Marina. Sorbents used to collect floating oil where access was available. Majority of oil trapped beneath floating docks making recovery difficult.   On Friday, 12/21, Senior Chief and FOSC Mike Steele, USCG Sector Baltimore contacted NOAA SSC to request permission to use Simple Green, a surface washing agent, to clean oiled floating docks and bulkeads.  I consulted direcly with DOI, NPS and FWS.  FWS (Peter McGowan) informed me that there are no federally listed species in the area and since Simple Green is practically nontoxic, they have no objection to the proposed use. As DOI and NPS likewise offered no objection, I contacted the CG and provided our concurrence.  Dave Anderson at NPS has been in touch with East Potomac Park staff regarding the spill.  The Park reports a light sheen adjacent to the Haines Point seawall near their HQs with a very light superficial band of oil on the seawall.   At this point, the Park is not interested in having the wall cleaned due to concerns about the stability of the structure.  Nonethless, I advised the CG to get in touch with the NPS via Dave Anderson.  FOSC Steele agreed to do so.  Nonrecoverable sheen has been carried by the incoming tide past the containment booms into the tidal basin.  CG estimates the size at 8 by 1200 feet hugging the Capitol side of the basin.  CG has directed the contractors to double boom the opening between the basin and the channel and use absorbents between the booms.  NPS will be notified.  Mike Steele has inspected the area and feels that it is non recoverable sheen; NPS understands and accepts thisevaluation. Mr Steele was going to provide contact information for GSA to the park in case anything changes."

Apparently, the floating lid on the tank had been canted as the result of the over-pressure from the heavy rain deluge of the past few days in Seattle putting a large pressure on the sides of the tank.    The Coast Guard requested NOAA to provide trajectory for a possible release, weather, tides and response consultation. The entire situation stabilized late Wednesday night as the tank lid, still canted, sank to the bottom of the tank.  After consultation with BP tank engineers, pumping off of the tank commenced Thursday and was completed Friday morning at 0600 LT with a total of 4354 Bbls of diesel removed.   From the response viewpoint, the incident was closed.     "

The sheening was first observed on October 11, 2007, and is currently only sheening minimally.  Nevertheless, Sector Anchorage has established an IC here in Anchorage to deal with the pollution.   Current plans are to get the PST, along with state and contract folks, to conduct an evaluation and appraisal of the situation probably beginning around the first of next week.   The sheening site is adjacent to a FUDS site in which the Army Corp of Engineers removed 2000 old drums containing only 100+ gallons of mixed petroleum fluids.  In addition to old military drums, the dump site has been used by locals for years and contains derelict fishing gear, batteries, old vehicles, some medical waste and on and on.  As a result, this response is being funded by CERCLA.  NOAA has asked the NWS to provide a weeks' worth of Spot forecasts beginning November 23 and is currently providing tidal data for the incident.   The Coast Guard assessed the situation, Nov. 28, when a six-man team consisting of Coast Guard, state of Alaska, and contractor reps flew to Port Heiden.     Their first impression was how much had changed at the dump site from the photos taken only one month previous.  No sheens or evidence of on-going releases was observed.   Numerous old fuel drums were in the intertidal zone, all seriously rusted and open to the environment.  In one and one-half months time, the shoreline embankment had eroded back from 10 to 40 feet.   As a result, both the FOSC and the SOSC agreed to close the case.  They asked the locals to continue monitoring the beach/dump site, and to remove any old batteries or minor amounts of oily fluids in drums that might appear.    Case Closed.    "

Due to warm ocean temperatures in the mid-80's F. and warm air temps in the 90's F, most if not 100% of the fuel oil would be expected to evaporate and dissipate within 24 hours or less from the time of the incident.

The initial response was included as one of more than one hundred small pollution cases investigated during the post-hurricane response under ESF-10.  Subsequently, this site was been identified as a chronic source of oil pollution that may be derived from some historical, subsurface oil spill incident that wasn't observed until after the hurricane eroded much of the marsh in SE Louisiana.  A possible source is a submerged pipeline.  The USCG has requested renewed assistance from NOAA in this investigation."

The vessel was experiencing bad weather at the time.  Contents of the containers is unknown at this time.  Containers Lost Overboard in Storm Friday, May 11, 2007  Styrofoam packing material began washing ashore on the beaches of the North Carolina Outer Banks Wednesday afternoon as a result of a container ship encountering severe weather off the coast. The debris field ranges from Cape Lookout northward to the Virginia border. The most densely littered areas are from Cape Lookout to Cape Hatteras. Late Sunday evening, the Hapag-Lloyd vessel Paris Express encountered severe weather in the Atlantic while en route from Savannah to Norfolk, resulting in the loss of 21 containers overboard, including some containing Styrofoam \"peanuts.\" None of the cargo involved was listed as hazardous material, although the Styrofoam could potentially be harmful to pristine National Seashore areas, including critical nesting habitat for endangered turtles and various bird species in the two National Seashores. The responsible party, Hapag-Lloyd, acted promptly and engaged a contractor, Moran Environmental Recovery, to take the necessary action to remove the debris immediately. Hapag-Lloyd is working closely in this clean up effort with the Unified Command, which includes the National Park Service, United States Coast Guard, and North Carolina Emergency Management. Other agencies involved include the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commision, Carteret County Emergency Management, Dare County Emergency Management, Hyde County Emergency Management, and Currituck County Emergency Management."

USCG and Conoco Phillips estimates that between 2,000-3,000 gallons of residual No. 6 oil spilled into a small freshwater pond that is located on the refinery's property.  The pond is connected to Morris's Mill Creek which is tidal and eventually discharges into the Arthur Kill.  Some oil did flow from the pond into the creek, but it was contained by fence boom, no oil made its way into the Arthur Kill.  "

About 6,000 gallons was released into the environment with the majority of it soaking into the surrounding ground. However, an unknown amount of styrene appears to have spilled onto the roadway and made its way into at least one if not several storm water drains.  These stormwater drains discharge into the New Haven River. USCG has a vessel on the river in the immediate area of the spill location.The USCG did report observing a sheen in the vicinity of the incident, but the sheen did not have any odor associated with it nor was it opaque in color what would be the expected color of the sheen if it was floating styrene.  Federal EPA (ERT, Edison, NJ) in route ans will serve as Federal OSC.  Connecticut DEP and USCG providing response support.

USEPA MA DEP and MA Fish and Wildlife were also notified and reported to the scene.  USDOI was notified due to shorebirds feeding on the dead fish, but did not response on-scene.  The kill included over 100 individuals within the 1/4 mile stretch of the creek investigated.  Although state, federal and local officials looked throughout the drainage system for a source, none has been located.  MA DEP obtain samples of the water and several marine fauna for later analysis.  No further action by the USCG is expected."

The ship was initially reported listing at about 80 degrees from vertical.  The ship has approximately 142,180 gallons of IFO-380 and 34,180 gallons of marine diesel fuel on board, in addition to the oil and gasoline in the autos. On Monday a sheen was reported about two miles in length emanating from the vessel.  The crew of 23 was rescued Monday by U.S. Coast Guard and National Guard helicopters.  One crew member suffered a broken leg before being rescued. After floating around in the N. Pacific Ocean for over a week, a tug from Seattle finally arrived and took the vessel under tow.    The tug was able to successfully tow the vessel to Unalaska Harbor, adjacent to Dutch Harbor, where the vessel was re-ballasted to a normal upright position.     No additional pollution occurred, and the Cougar Ace was towed to Vancouver where the automobiles were all sent to the junk yard.  "

The vessel's crew detected a strong odor prior to coming into and once at the terminal (though the vessel did not report the potential release until at the terminal).  The source of the odor has not been confirmed but may be one of four ISO containers of methyl acrylatel.  Methyl acrylate, an inhibited polymer, is highly flammable and may represent an explosive hazard depending on the circumstances of the release.  First responders have been advised to determine if there is heat generation, an indication of chemical reaction and potential explosion risk.  Methyl acrylate is a serious inhalation and contact hazard.  The vapors are heavier than air and can pool.  First responders have been advised to use appropriate protective gear, to establish conservative isolation distances, and to monitor constantly.  The SSC and Hazmat chemist are standing by to provide further assistance remotely or on-scene. "

The Ingrid is a 964 vessel currently at the anchorage just outside the port of Savannah.  The crew notified the USCG of a odor from the tank containing the ethyl mercaptin.  No visible leak or puddle has been observed.  USCG confirmed the material is not stored in the appropriate type of tank and a deteriated gasket seal at the service port of the tank is suspect.  USCG MSU Savannah asked NOAA to provide chemical hazard information as a contingency.  Currently, the USCG had the vessel brought into port the evening of March 3. The tank with the Ethyl Mercaptin was safely repaired (a faulty valve was the culprit) and offloaded Saturday March 4th and then shipped via truck and the incident was closed.    "

Owner stated the vessel had capsized and sank approximately 5 NM off Long Point, Catalina Island. Vessel crew had abandoned ship into their lifeboat and made their way to Camp Fox, a YMCA campground on the beach just east of Long Point. Initial reports indicated the vessel sunk due to heavy weather, however, an overflight revealed that the vessel was still adrift. This first light overflight revealed the vessel, but no further debris or visible pollution. Crew was flown from Catalina Island to Long Beach where interviews and medical testing was conducted. Preliminary reports indicate that vessel took water over port side and capsized. Vessel had approximately 1000 gallons of fuel and 15 tons of squid on board. Later reports by Baywatch Isthmus revealed a release coming from the vessel. Insurers have been notified and are taking responsibility for this case. An overflight with a Coast Guard rider will take place at first light on 24JAN. Confirmed upon an early morning flight with a Pollution Investigator on board, the vessel has drifted onto Blue Cavern Point just north of Isthmus (Catalina Island). There is no recoverable oil at this time, and the responsible party is working with a contractor to put together a dive/salvage plan. Update: Insurance company has now hired NRC to complete clean up operations. NRC will present a complete salvage plan on 26JAN."

The NOAA SSC was notified at 0700 and requested to provide trajectory analysis, weather, and tides and current information. Also discussed were response options, including releasing the oil from the containment boom, the use of firefighting foam to inhibit any potential explosive hazard, and the use of fire hoses to spray along the shoreline to keep the gasoline away and to break up the slick. The New Have Fire Department was on scene and acting as the Incident Commander. They did not have any way to apply foam to the spill. The boom was opened about 0800 on an ebb tide."

    "description": "Monday afternoon US Coast Guard, Sector Boston was notified of a release in the area of the Island End River in Boston Harbor.  The source, the amount and the product were (and remain) unconfirmed.  However, it is suspected that the release happened sometime on the night of Sunday January 08 and was a diesel or #2 heating oil product (chemical analysis through the  USCG Marine Safety Lab is pending) and the amount is somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 gallons. Helped by slow currents and consistent west to southwest winds, a large portion of the released product pooled at the northern end of the Island End River (IER) and recovery operations have been focused there.  Some oil sheen was reported in the Mystic River (upper end of Boston Harbor) and in the Chelsea River, about a half a mile east of the IER, but none of it was deemed recoverable.  Protective booming of the salt marshes at the end of the Chelsea River (aka: \"Chelsea Creek\") was deployed as an extra safety measure. The Island End River is more of an inlet than a true river.  Historically (a century ago) it flowed through Chelsea and Everett to the sea.  Today it terminate approximately a quarter mile from the Mystic River (generally considered part of Boston Harbor), is about 200 yards wide and heavily industrialized on one side.  The other side has a small park and condominium project known as Admiral Hill.  Environmentally the area is of note due to historic (and heavy) contamination from coal tar.  The bottom sediments as well as much of the southeastern shoreline are contaminated by chronic (now secured) and acute releases of the materials.  The exposed coal tar on the shoreline dates back to the 1940s.  The material is a byproduct of a large coal gasification facility that operated from the turn of the 19th century to sometime in the early 1960s.   Response Activities: The USCG has been supervising the oil spill cleanup contractor as it uses vacuum trucks and sorbents to recover trapped materials.  Over 3,000 gallons (oil) have been recovered thus far.  NOAA Activities: The NOAA SSC has been working with the FOSC and SOSC on cleanup options and spill characterization, including work with the NOAA HAZMAT modeling staff on oil fate calculations, and reverse trajectories."

The vessel was carrying an estimated 6,000 gal diesel fuel, and was not leaking.  On Friday, Jan 5th, the vessel was located at 72deg 28.63' W by 40deg 50.44'N.  Plans were in place to move the vessel to 72deg 28.96' W by 40deg 50.57'N on Saturday afternoon at about 1400. The vessel was estimated to have between 4,000 and 6,000 gallons of diesel fuel onboard. The Hail Mary II was hung up on the west bank of jetty lining the Shinnecock Inlet. The offshore weather conditions prohibited the arrival of a barge with crane to do the salvage operation. The USCG received the RP's salvage plan and eventually allowed the fishing vessel to be lifted and taken for repairs."

The oil appeared to be waste oil and was seen floating between the Martin Luther King Bridge and the I 280 Bridge.   The volume was estimated to be between 500 - 5000 gallons.   Early reports indicated no shoreline or wildlife impacts, although there were reports of oiled vessels.   The oil did not match any vessels in the area during the spill.   A sewer outfall on the eastern shore near the MLK bridge was indicated as a possible source. An overflight showed heavy sheens and free product from the MLK bridge to the CSX railroad bridge.   Scattered pockets of oil were seen on both banks.  Shoreline impacts seem to be mostly in areas of riprap.  A marina south of the MLK bridge on the east bank acted as a natural collection point.  There were no known impacts to wildlife.   A local clean up contractor recovered oil along an area of riprap."

    "description": "On October 3, 2005, a fatal crash between a SUV and gasoline tank truck on the Seven Mile Bridge near Marathon, FL, resulted in a large fire and release of gasoline and fire fighting foam into the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.  The burning fuel truck was extinguished using Aqueous Fire Fighting Foam (AFFF).  NOAA HAZMAT was requested to provide information on the potential fate of the spilled gasoline and AFFF.  Given the relatively small volumes involved, we believe that discernible impacts are unlikely.  However, recent concerns regarding the environmental impacts from AFFF suggest that sampling of bivalves and corals adjacent to the bridge might be prudent.  See Biological concerns report posted to hotline for more details.   "

The drain was approximately 2 miles from Lake Michigan.     The USCG FOSC wanted information on the potential impacts from dilute calcium chloride solution on the biota in Lake Michigan.    The local fire department was preparing to flush the storm drain with copious amounts of water. The local fire department ultimately flushed the drain with 3000 gallons of water per minute for 3 hours.    The flushing water entered the drain at three different locations on the run to the lake.   The drain entered the lake in an open area, which would allow for maximum dilution. The USCG reported no impacts from the flushing of the CaCl to Lake Michigan."

Representatives of the RP, VA DEQ, NOAA DAC, EPA, MSO Hampton Roads, F&WS, and Entrix joined in  a survey of the one site where the oil had been collected located just east of the site of the grounding.   Area impacted in this pond area off of the East Bank of the James River, known locally as the Gravel Pit,  total less than an acre.  Diesel product was observed along this sheltered shore that once the  floating product had been removed,  oil soaked woody debris had been removed, that some sorbent  material would be maintained on site for several days or weeks until it could be assured that oil sheen  from saturated sediments would not escape into the James River."

The barge was moored at the Dynergy facility in Roseton, NY. It reported slight sheen around it and believed the damage was to the #1 and #2 port tanks (each containing 7,500 barrels of gasoline). ACTNY requested NOAA support for weather and trajectory information.   The barge initially had 75,145 bbls of gasoline.  Using the figures provided by the RP the amount lost would be 683 bbls or 28,686 gallons.  The amount of product and water combined is 89,823 bbls which means that during the several times they lightered they took on an additional 7,803 bbls of water (the barges total capacity is only 82,020 bbls).  The barge was single hulled and they believed it sustained an impact with the bottom near Diamond Reef (NE of buoy #56) while heading up river.   Weather at time of incident was winds 12 knots from the SW, air temperature 41F, and visibility 10NM.  The waterway remained open to all traffic with a Safety Broadcast for no-wake speed in the vicinity of the incident. The contractor conducted air monitoring of LEL and benzene levels. None were detected. Protective boom was deployed at the mouth of Wappinger Creek."

CG reported they believe the vessel is aground on coral.  Fuel on board was initially reported as 500 metric tons of #6 fuel oil.  This information was later updated to be 180 metric tons of #6 and an unknown quantity of diesel fuel.  The diesel fuel was being transfered to inside tanks for added security. NOAA provided contingency trajectory information and weather forecasts to the USCG MSD in St Croix.  After lightering the majority of fuel, the vessel was successfully re-floated without incident the morning of March 28 and taken into dock for hull inspection.  There was no significant damage to the hull.  NOAA DAC coordiantied with co-trustees to assess damage to the reef grounding site.  "

    "description": "On Tuesday, 22 March, 2005, the MV CSAV Maresias waited off Charleston Harbour with six damaged containers due to bad weather offshore while in transit.  The containers include tetrachloroethylene and methylene chloride solvents and choronated parafin wax.  The USCG asked NOAA to assess toxicity, reactivity, and response concerns for these products.  Also NOAA was asked to evaluate the photo ionization (PID) detection results performed by the RP. NOAA chemists and LSU contract chemists were given the cargo information to evaluate for hazards. USCG ordered the vessel to remain at anchor offshore until a plan was submitted to address offloading of the damaged containers, monitoring for toxic gas, and a contingency for dealing with any leaking or released product. NOAA Chemists reviewed the details of the plan prior to the vessel being allowed to enter port to verify correct monitoring methods.  On the evening of Wednesday, 23 March USCG accepted the RP's plan for offloading the damaged containers, monitoring, and contingencies for any spillage. The vessel was allowed to enter port and offload.  The operation was successful and without incident.  The vessel departed the area at 0200 EST on 24 March 2005."

(NRC report 753234).  The oil spill occured during a transfer operation when the pipeline supplying fuel to a vessel apparently ruptured due to corrosion.  The rupture occured 5000 yards inland.  An estimated 50 gallons of oil entered the waterway.  The remainder of the release (7000 Bbls or 294,000 gallons) was mostly contained on land in a containment area of pipes and an adjacent ditch.  USCG D7 requested NOAA develop weather forecast, tide and current predictions, and resources at risk information in the event of a significant release into the waterway.  Recovery operations were effective, and little oil entered the waterway and the oil has remained effectively contained primarily in a land ditch. The only wildlife impacts reported were one egret oiled, but mangrove habitat along the ditch was oiled.  "

USCG requested information as to the movement and fate of this oil.  NOAA provided a weather forecast, ADIOS oil fate output, and analysis of oil movement.  NOAA provided the following trajectory forecast: The oil would likely move to the NW or NNW at about 1/2 knot.  A visible sheen would only be discernable for 3 miles maximum. Within 11 hours the oil should brake up, evaporate or naturally disperse.  No shoreline impacts should occur from the spill. USCG reported that no visible of sheen was reported or observed following the release of diesel.  USCG closed the case without further action.  "

    "description": "The 100 foot yacht TV ran aground at approximately 2200 EST on 16 March 2005 at the entrance to Port Everglades on the north jetty.  The position of the grounding is 26-05.671N; 080-06.222W as reported by USCG.  The vessel had 7000 gallons of diesel oil onboard at time of grounding.  Hull damage has occurred and the engine room is flooded with free communication with the sea.  Lightering of the fuel took place using vac trucks on the shore.  Some water in the flooded engine room mixed with engine oil and lube oils. A conference call was held with the incident specific RRT to discuss decanting and discharge of the oily engine room water if necessary during a refloat operation.  The RRT agreed to this operational tradeoff if necessary.  Coast Guard agreed that attempts to lighter all fuel and the oily seawater would be conducted prior to a refloat attempt.  If decanting and discharge of the oily water becomes necessary, the discharge would be directed into a containment boom with sorbent materials for recovery of any oil sheens.  Pump rates would be controlled to eliminate or minimize any sheens into the water.  Protection measures for sensitive areas inside the cut have been reviewed and boom and sorbents will be ready for deployment at turtle nesting sites to the north and to protect mangroves and Whiskey Creek to the south.  The potential use of special solidifier products are being considered to remove sheen from the engine room and as a filter for the oily water discharge.  The M/V TV was successfully refloated at 1430 EST, March 18th.  Once refloated, the vessel did not appear completely stable, so the Coast Guard decided to direct the vessel to a nearby facility at the Dania cutoff canal rather than the planned facility further away in the New River.  The vessel made it safely to the facility without incident. No spill or even visible sheening was reported during the entire refloat and movement operation.  The vessel damage will be further assesed and repaired enough to continue to the New River facility or removed from the water by sling at the Dania location.  "

It has a fixed CO2 fire suppression system in the engine room and it appears that the fire may be coming under control. The tugs Ralph Bouchard and Frederick  Bouchard are enroute. The plan is for the Ralph to come along side, disconnect the barge and take the  towed barge from the Robert and bring it to Philadelphia. The Frederick will then hook up to the Robert and tow it to NYC. The salvage vessel from Don Jon Marine is due on scene shortly. That vessel will make an assessment of the condition of the Robert and decide if it is safe to tow. "

The crew was evacuated and the vessel continued to burn as it drifted freely.  At 0800 local 2 February the vessel was at position 27-24.1N; 083-19.7W and at 1000 local a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft overflew the area and noted the position as 27-23.8N; 083-21.4W.  The vessel was still burning (smoldering) and continuing to drift. No pollution was observed.  The vessel has a capacity for 9000 gallons of diesel fuel, but the amount of fuel onboard at the time of the fire was not initially known.   NOAA Hazmat provided the COTP with a weather forecast for the area as well as spill trajectory and oil fate information.  During the afternoon of 2 February, MSO Tampa had discussions with the vessel operator, who said the vessel had only 1000 gallons or less fuel onboard at the time the fire started.  Given the small amount of diesel and distance offshore, the MSO ceased further actions or monitoring of this case.  Coast Guard District 7 office followed up with discussions between the owner/operator and the vessel's insurance company to insure proper handling and salvage of the boat remains. "

    "description": "A fuel-oil tanker ran aground in the East River. It was first feared that some of the 446-foot long barge's 130,000 barrels of home-heating oil on board had spilled.  But by daybreak divers determined not a drop had leaked. The barge was towed to the docks under the Whitestone Bridge, and divers were in the water just after 6:30 a.m. to look at the extent of the damage. The tugboat hauling that barge ran aground around 7:20 p.m. Thursday near the Hell's Gate Bride. A Staten Island transportation company owns the tugboat. The captain was tested for drugs and alcohol and tests came back negative. The barge is now being assessed for stability. NOAA provide trajectory and weather information."

The vessel had 8000 gallons of diesel fuel and 200 gallons of lube oil on board.  The vessel's position at 1400 was reported to be N24 deg 35.1min, W80deg 48.7min, which is 5.7 mi. outside of the FKNMS boundary.  After consultation with Sanctuaries about resource concerns, and NOAA HAZMAT regarding potential drift trajectory, the USCG proposed sinking the vessel before it drifted into Sanctuary waters.  That evening at 9:15 pm the vessel sank at position N24deg 47.5min, W80deg 33.6min (approximately 2.2 miles from the FLKNMS boundary) in 370 feet of water.  USCG cutter Drummond had been dousing the smoldering vessel with water to extinguish the fire to allow for the attachment of tow lines so the vessel could be towed further offshore and sunk, but the vessel sank on its own before the towing could be accomplished. At the time of sinking, no report was made of observed oil on the water, however since it was dark, it was difficult to assess.  At dawn the next day an overflight reported no sighting of pollution.  Information sources: NOAA hotlines and Chief Donald Whittle, CG station Key West. "

    "description": "During early December of 2004, a huge storm drove the floundering M/V Selendang Ayu onto the rockly shoals on the west side of Unalaska Island, where the vessel broke in two releasing over 75%  (337,000 gallons) of its total petroleum fuel products of IFO-380 and marine diesel.   Nearly all the oil was driven onto the mostly rocky shorelines of Makushin and Skan Bays.  Within two weeks the bow section had sunk; however, the stern section remained afloat with the balance of the fuel.    From early January, 2005, until mid-February, 2006, a heavy lift helicopter was used to lighter this fuel from the stern section with over 70 round trips to Dutch Harbor, 25 miles away, and using a 2000 gallon steel sling-loaded cube.   Due to the potential for an additional release during this period, skimmers and dispersants (Corexit 9500) were maintained as standby response measures.   Reasonable weather during these operations allowed for reconnaisance SCAT evaluation and some modest manual shoreline cleanup. 2005 winter operations were halted around mid February due to deteoriating weather conditions.         In mid-April, 2005, SCAT and full shoreline cleanup teams returned to Unalaska Island and worked into October, 2005, until again winter weather shut down the operation with only a couple dozen of over one hundred shoreline segments needing further cleaning and/or inspection.   Modest SCAT personnel and shoreline cleanup folks returned in May, 2006, to complete the final shoreline cleanup and inspections.    Manual shoreline cleanup was the dominate technique utilized; however dry mechanical tilling and berm relocation were used quite successfully on the appropriate shorelines.       One of the key peripheral issues involved possible oiling of the commercial sea food harvest that is caught around and processed on Unalaska Island.  Heightened monitorning and inspections resulted in the finding of no oiled fish products.   Another issue was the oiling and tainting of traditional and subsistence food harvested by the Alaska natives who live on the island.   Task forces of federal, state,  local, and industry representatives were established to deal with these issues.              "

The truck was loaded with 27 tons of lime.  The exact amount spilled into the Creek is unknown, but preliminary visual estimates suggest that up to 20 tons may have spilled into the Creek.  Powells creek enters the Potomac River just south of Occuquan Bay, approximately 25 miles downstream of Washington D.C.    The spilled lime is having a visible exothermic reaction in the creek and the water is boiling near the release site.  In addition to the heat given off by the reaction, there is concern regarding elevated pH.  NOAA has requested chemistry support from LSU to evaluate the potential fates and behavior of the spilled lime.  This portion of Powells Creek is tidally influenced and is an environmentally sensitive area.  NOAA resources, primarily anadromous and catadromous fish species, are present in this area and there are already reports of fish kills.    "

A 15-foot curved piece of pipe was ultimately found with the assistance of the NOAA Navigation Response Team.  After further examination, the hull showed evidence that the ship may  have hit more than one object.  The tanker, registered in Cyprus, was carrying 325,000 barrels (13.6 million gallons) of heavy  crude oil from Venezuela.  The collision(s) created three holes, the largest a 6-foot by 2-foot tear in the hull that breached  a center cargo tank and port side water ballast tank, releasing approximately 264,000 gallons.  After the incident, a review  of PORTS tide level recordings showed the collision(s) occurred at maximum spring low tide.  The oil from the ruptured  tank spread down river, ultimately oiling 57 miles of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware shorelines.  The spill closed the  Delaware River to commercial vessel traffic for over a week.  Submerged oil resulted in contamination of water intakes and  the closure of the Salem Nuclear Power Plant."

The storage tank's capacity was 500,000 gallons.  An unknown amount of product entered the Arthur Kill waterway that separates New Jersey and Staten Island, New York.  An unknown amount was contained within the tank's dike system and the facility's storm water containment system.  In addition, as a result of the tank failure a second tank sustained damage and also leaked an unknown amount of sodium hydroxide but this leak has been contained.  Three individuals were suffered burns.  Two were treated and released, third is being held in the hospital for further observations.  The RP in cooperation with the USCG are in the process of determining how much product entered the Arthur Kill.  Cause of the incident is under investigation.    Sodium hydroxide solution is a liquid caustic soda.  It is a colorless solution that contains components that are corrosive, and can be damaging to human health and the environment.  At 50% solution, the product has a specific gravity of 1.53 and a density of 12.76.  Sodium hydroxide solution can substantially raise the pH of an aquatic environment and can be extremely toxic to fish and aquatic plants.   "

Upon investigation by ACTNY and NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) personnel, the source of the spill was identified as an apartment complex about three miles inland. The discharge came from a heating oil tank in the basement of an apartment building.  Approximately 3,400 gallons of number 6 fuel oil discharged from a hole in the return fuel line between the boiler and the storage tank.  NYCDEP traced discharge from outfall in Weir Creek through sewer line to floor drain in basement of apartment building.  The on-scene weather was partly cloudy, wind 17 mph from the north; air temperature 64 degrees F, sea state 1 foot. \t ACTNY opened the OSLTF and hired a cleanup contractor. Once a Responsible Party (RP) was identified they took over the cleanup cost. The contractor initially deployed containment and sorbent boom at the mouth of the outfall and around the Creek entrance. \t Federal and state supervision of the RP and contractor was supplied by the USCG and NYS Department of Environmental Conservation."

The grounding occurred at approximately 9:30 pm on July 31, 2004, rupturing only the forward fuel tank which contained about 5000 gallons of diesel, all of which was released.   At the time of the grounding, 196 passengers were on board the Clipper Odyssey.   These passengers were all evacuated via local fishing vessel, etc. from Dutch Harbor and transported back to Dutch Harbor.  With the assistance of two tugs, the salvor Magone Marine stabilized the vessel early morning of Aug. 1 after which it proceded to Dutch Harbor.  Oil containment boom was placed around the vessel upon arrival in Dutch Harbor.  Diesel fuel was reportedly leaking from the damaged #1 port tank immediately after the grounding and enroute to Dutch Harbor.  The response contractor, Chadux, was activated and pre-staged response equipment in Dutch Harbor.  The Baby Islands are part of the US Maritime National Wildlife Refuge and as such are loaded with a variety of birds.   No oiled birds were observed, however, the IBRRC was alerted.   NOAA provided support in the form of weather forecasts, tidal current information, trajectories of the diesel release, and resources at risk information.   "

Before the tug could recover the KTC 115, it grounded on Frontenac Shoal in position 44deg 20.408' N 075deg 55.508' W near Alexander Bay NY.  KTC-115 contained 35% calcium chloride solution.   The barge sustained damage to the starboard tank, which contained 170,000 gallons.  Over 12,000 gallons spilled from the tank before it reached equilibrium. Divers found three cracks near the starboard bow. NOAA provided a worst case scenario for a release of the product."

The initial report to the USCG was of oil spraying 300' into the air from a wellhead.  As additional information became available, the magnitude of the problem was much less than originally reported.  The release was caused by a pipeline value failure on a small platform located at 29deg 04' 39\" N Lat. 090deg 52' 14\" W Long.  Because of the pressure in the line, the release did create a visible plume, but very little oil was released.  The RP reported that only about 30 gallons was actually lost.  A small slick was observed at the platform and moving toward open water.  An overflight by the USCG identified no oil (or no oil observations of any significance).  The light sheen probably dissipated rapidly.  NOAA did provide weather and trajectory support based on the initial reports of a potential major oil release. "

The vessel was hard aground and suffered significant damage, including multiple stress fractures.  However, no oil (deisel) was released.  Nevertheless, boom was deployed around the vessel and lightering commenced up to 3000 gallons remaining onboard as an operational supply.   A substantial amount of response equipment was on-scene and a salvage barge was en route from Seattle.   Potential harbors of refuge were evaluated in the vicinity of Cozian Reef.  Arrangements were made for bird hazing in the event of an oil release impacting nearby tidal flats.  Resource experts from both NOAA Fisheries and the US Fish and Wildlife Servcie were consulted and assisted in assessment of resources at risk.   The LaConte was stabilized and anchored at Cozian Reef for the lightering and for temporary patches to the hull prior to towing the vessel to Ketchikan for permanent repairs in their drydock facility.   The ferry was refloated and moved off the reef on May 17, and after confirming that the temporary patches were adequate, the vessel was towed to Ketchikan for repairs.   "

At that time, the identified problem, i.e., the failure of two gaskets, was repaired and no subsequent emissions were observed.  During assessment activities, it was discovered that the product was \"off-spec\" and the barge was not certified for such a product.  The NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC) worked with USCG Marine Safety Unit Baton Rouge to address concerns related to the stability of the barge product and plans to off-load the product to prevent subsequent releases that might threaten local communities.   Off-loading of the cargo began at approximately 0914 hrs on 10 June after several small delays during final configuration of the modified scrubber.  The NOAA SSC was on-scene to assist the USCG in operational oversight and air monitoring coordination."

The 289-foot Stellamare, a heavy lift ship from Willemstad, Curacao, in the Netherlands Antilles was loading two General Electric turbines when it leaned to port side and overturned. The Coast Guard sent a 49-foot boat from Saugerties, NY to the port to assess the situation. Also, a team of Coast Guard investigators left Staten Island, NY by car for the port. The following morning the owners had the vessel boomed in and skimmers removing oil contained with the boom. Overflights were able to identify oil sheen covering about seven miles of the river downstream from the ship. The USCG Activities New York oversaw the spill response and recovery operations, which lasted about three days. The vessel and turbine salvages are still pending. At the time of the initial incident it was reported that the river was about 80% covered with ice. As the water warmed up in the daytime the percent of ice diminished greatly."

Coast Guard Activities New York representatives arrived on-scene at 1103 to investigate and oversee response operations.  As the Federal On-Scene Coordinator, Activities New York oversaw the Responsible Party's cleanup efforts, opened a pollution fund number for their own expenditures, and is responding from the ACTNY office on Staten Island. Other responding agencies were notified per standard procedures, and some deployed to ACT NY or engaged through phone contact.  Further work was done to determine how much of the potential 79,800 gallons was actually discharged to the deck of the vessel, and how much migrated to the water. Shoreline impacts were observed along a 1/4 to 1/2 mile of beach south of Norton Point on Coney Island, with sheen visible from the Verrazano Narrows Bridge to Coney Island during an overflight prior to sunset.  The impacted area was snared to reduce refloating, and protection efforts were focused on Coney Island Creek and Inlet, but other response operations occurred after first light overflights and shoreline assessments. It was determined on the second day that the total amount spilled was less than 5,000 gallons."

    "description": "On Wednesday afternoon, Oct. 15, 2003, the F/V Raven, an 85'crabber, was poised north of the Alaska Peninsula to begin crabbing when heavy seas caused it to take on considerable water, producing a 30-40 degree starboard list.   Fearful of capsizing, the captain put out a MAYDAY and all five crewmen were lifted from the vessel by a Coast Guard helicopter.   Northeasterly winds caused the unmanned crabbing to drift parallel to the coast until the afternoon of Oct. 16 when it was in a position 12 to 15 miles due north of Amak Island.  With winds shifting to the north the Coast Guard became very concerned that it might ground on Amak Island, the site of a sea lion haulout, classified as an endangered species.   At this point the Coast Guard asked NOAA to get involved and provide a \"most likely\" trajectory for the vessel.   NOAA's trajectory had the F/V Raven just missing the east side of the island and grounding on the barrier islands outside of Izembek Lagoon, a National Wildlife Refuge being very sensitive with its large number of transient waterfowl waiting to migrate southward.   The CGC Morgenthau was on scene shadowing the Raven but was unable to attach a towline due to the heavy seas.   Instead, it attached a drogue, which slowed the movement of the vessel.  Meanwhile the owner hired Dan Magone from Unalaska to attempt to come to the scene and offer assistance.   Dan arrived when the Raven was only 1 nautical mile off the NE coast of Amak Island, and in a dramatic rescue was able to get a line on the vessel only 0.3 nm from the island and keep it from grounding.    The Raven was towed to the lee of the island where it was stabilized, outfitted with a better tow bridle, and then was towed to King Cove to be repaired.   The case ended with no pollution entering the water."

The RP requested and received RRT approval to use PES 51 to aid in removing a 4 inch band of  oil from around 2 barges and a tow boat.  Proposed clean up operations are to  spray PES 51 on rags and sorbent, then wiping down the sides of the vessels.  It  is estimated that less than 30 gallons of PES 51 will be needed to complete this  portion of the clean up.  Little or no PES 51 will enter the water.   Little or no environmental impact is expected with this planned use of PES 51."

The vessel was anchored in Tanglefoot Bay adjacent the community of Karluk on the west side of Kodiak Island.   The vessel had 1000 gallons of diesel and finally came to rest at position N57-34.4, W154-29.4 where an on-scene observer reported surf crashing through the wheelhouse. Planned CG helo overflight for August 21 was canceled due to the helo mechanical problems.  Instead the CG opened up the Liability Trust Fund and hired a fixed wing Beaver to fly from Kodiak and assess the situation, the report from which won't be available until the morning of August 22.   NOAA has provided support with weather and resources at risk information.  By Thursday night, Aug. 21, the NW winds are expected to drop to 5-15 kts, and by late Friday the wind should shift around to the SW at 10-15 kts.   The grounding site is about one-half mile east of Cape Karluk, the site of a seabird rookery and about one mile west of the village of Karluk and the Karluk Lagoon which supports salmon runs May through November.   The Lagoon is also the site of sea ducks, occasional sea otters, and occasional brown bear activity.  PolRep 2 and final:  Joint Coast Guard/ADEC team flew to Karluk on Thursday afternoon, August 21, and were able to board the F/V Donna Ann.  The wheelhouse had been separated from the hull as a result of the prolonged beating by the heavy surf and the old wooden hull was in pretty bad shape.  It was determined that all the diesel had been purged from the tanks and been dispersed in the large and turbulent seas. "

The location of the sunken vessel was N60-33.0, W145-46.3, and it went down with an estimated 500 gallons of diesel in an area of very strong tidal currents.  A long oil slick was noted on the surface, and it was believed that this was just the fuel emanating from the vents and that the two fuel tanks were intact.   Trying to beat some forecast heavy winds for the night of August 19, the owner immediately hired divers to plug the vents.  In so doing the divers noted that the starboard tank was empty of an estimated 200 gallons of diesel.   The next day, when the strong winds never materialized, divers again descended to the vessel to attempt to pump out the port fuel tank, but found it empty also.   Apparently all the fuel  had escaped the first day and been rapidly dispersed by the strong tidal currents, and there was probably less than 500 gallons of diesel on the vessel when in sank.  NOAA provided support to the CG with weather, tidal and resources at risk information.   Several sea otters and seabirds were in the vicinity, but a wildlife observer from the local Eyak native community noted no abnormal behavior."

Not until a Coast Guard helo from station Kodiak delivered two additional pumps was the vessel able to control the flooding.  The next morning a welder and marine surveyor were on scene to assess  and repair the damaged bow with a patch over the roughly 1 foot X 1 foot hole.   By Saturday, August 9, the vessel was fully repaired and back fishing.  NOAA supported the Coast Guard in dealing with this incidence by providing detailed weather information and forecasts, tidal data, and resources at risk information."

When the vessel sank it was reported to have a capacity of some 8,000 gallons of diesel fuel.  At 1600 hours of 17 July the Coast Guard's Fifth Coast Guard District \"M\" staff requested from NOAA a trajectory for the diesel fuel that might be released from the tanks of the F/V Four Daughters.  By 1715 hours NOAA provided to the Fifth Coast Guard District initial trajectory and weather reports.  NOAA suggested that no diesel products were expected to contact the shoreline from a release from a sunken vessel at this distance offshore.  NOAA's report also stated that if oil did leak diesel from the vessel that \"we would expect some rainbow to silver sheen to extend for several hundred yards downwind of the location where the vessel sank.\"  The detailed NOAA weather report that was provided to the Coast Guard outlined that winds would be light and variable at 5-10 knots on Thursday night and on Friday with a chance of isolated showers and thunderstorms on Friday afternoon.  MSO Philadelphia reported to Fifth District that a Coast Guard over-flight of the area on the afternoon of 17 July did observe some wreckage from the F/V Four Daughters, but did not observe any floating oil."

    "description": "On 07JUN03, at approx. 0830, MSFO Long Island personnel received call from Group/MSO Long Island Sound that Bouchard Barge B NO. 160, 3 miles off of Riverhead, NY, Long Island Sound, was releasing # 6 oil and creating a sheen.  After receiving permission from the facility, the barge returned to the Conoco Philips Platform in Riverhead, NY, where they had just finished loading 110K gals of #6 oil.  The sheen was first noticed at 0720 by the barge captain, Joe Barrett, when the barge was 2 miles east of the platform.  The barge returned to the platform and moored at 0945.  Bouchard Transportation hired Miller Environmental Group (MEG) and the National Response Corporation to address pollution concerns.  MEG boomed the barge and had two boats standing by on scene.  MSFO pollution investigator and MSFO marine inspector arrived on scene at approx 1000 and observed that the barge was intermittently sheening from under the water line at the bow. A Notice of Federal Interest was issued.  The barge had not been involved in any grounding, allisions, or collisions since the crew had been on board.  Bouchard hired divers to locate the source of the release.  At 1730 the divers reported a hairline crack, approx 6-12\" long, on the bottom of number one starboard tank.  The divers were able to secure the release by placing an epoxy patch on the crack.  A CG-835 was issued to the barge prohibiting the transfer of oil, after discharging at Riverhead, until the barge was presented for inspection and repairs were made.  The B NO. 160 was giving permission to discharge her product back to the facility.  They completed transfer at 1030 on 08JUN03, and the barge made way for dry docking and repairs in Staten Island, NY.  The pictures taken by inspectors from ACTNY show a 10-12\" hairline crack that was located in the #1 starboard cargo tank bottom.  The fracture is apparently in way of a consistently stressed area of the barge where the forward rake slopes down to meet the forward tanks.  This causes fractures in the weld supports and bottom longitudinals.  It is believed that this crack is a result of an area that has been affected by heat to repair these longitudinals numerous times.  NOAA supplied sensitive area information, trajectory and weather support to the FOSC. No oil was observed on any shoreline areas."

Dr. Jim Farr helped to narrow the most likely possibilities to UN 2735 (an amine) or UN1760 (acids/bases).  Subsequently, additional Dangerous Cargo Manifest information for the container was provided.  Based on this information, it was determined the substance was likely ethanolamine or sodium hydroxide.  Since ethanolamine generally has a strong ammonia odor, it was concluded that the substance most likely was caustic solution (sodium hydroxide).  Relevant MSDS, handling, and other information was provided to the MSO."

It is insoluble in water. It is expected to float in seawater. At the time of the explosion the vessel was located at 41 degrees 12 minutes N; 71 degrees 51 minutes W; approximately 50 miles south of Montauk Point, NY. The weather on-scene was winds expected from the south at 10 knots shifting to the west at 20-25 knots by the late afternoon hours. After about an hour the ship reported that the actual amount released to the sea by the explosion was about two gallons. The USCG requested weather and a forecast for the movement any possible floating product released by the ship. No response was mounted."

    "description": "21 February 2003 - The NOAA SSC was contacted multiple times around 1100 and requested to report to the  USCG Activities New York command center on Staten Island, NY. Upon arriving at the  command center at noon the SSC was briefed about the barge explosion and  subsequent gasoline spill. The barge (what was left of it) and manifold system on the  dock were still on fire. The location of the ExxonMobile facility was: 40deg 31.5 N / 74deg 14.5  W. Trajectory and weather support were requested ASAP as well as resources at risk. Oil  weathering calculations determined that the gasoline would evaporate very quickly  (about 90% in the first several hours). The two major biological concerns from the  environmental point of view were rafting waterfowl and potential fish kill. The SSC  recommended that the fire be left burning as long as possible as long as it posed no  further hazard to the facility or workers, to minimize the amount of gasoline released onto  the waterway. The other safety concern expressed was the potential for gasoline to  become trapped under piers and docks creating the potential for other explosive  conditions.  The two pipelines from the facility to the pier that were ruptured contained about 150,000  gallons each from the value to the end. One was on fire and the other leaking onto the  facility.  At 1530 the SSC and a MSRC representative went on an overflight of the area on a  USCG helicopter. The SSC took video footage and digital photographs of the event as  well as mapping the extent and quantity of oil observed in the Arthur Kill. At the time of  the flight the tide was ebbing to the south. Oil was noted at the entrance to the Kills, for  the most part remaining in the center of the waterway. The gasoline was mostly rainbow  and gray sheens extending up to the facility. North of the site there were two other  sheens noted, one probably leaching from the landfill site and another mystery sheen.  The smoke plume was very visible. It wafted up about 125 feet to 300 feet and northward  over Staten Island. The SSC returned to the command post and presented the video and  observations to the unified command. The gasoline was for the most part non- recoverable. It was estimated that the amount observed was in the thousands of gallons,  not tens of thousand or hundreds of thousands. Most of the fuel spilled was consumed in  the fire or evaporated.  The SSC notified Tri-State Bird Rescue of the spill and potential for oiled birds. No birds  were found to be oiled.  The SSC also converted video footage taken by the Vessel Traffic Service into a digital  format for distribution to the media and investigating agencies.  22 February 2003 ?  The SSC was supposed to participate in a first light overflight with the USCG. However,  the rain and fog prohibited the aircraft from flying.   At the 0800 unified command meeting a situation update was given. The manifold was  still burning and would be attempted to inert and cap that morning. Joint investigations  were underway by the NYC Fire Department Fire Marshals, Police Department Arson  Investigations, US Coast Guard, and National Transportation Safety Board. The  investigators were attempting to map the location of all of the debris. DonJon Marine was  preparing a salvage plan. The Kills were still under one-way traffic with tug escorts. A  sight safety plan was in place. NOAA was requested to continue weather updated for the  next couple of days.  The SSC participated in a news interview with the Staten Island Advance.  Shoreline assessment teams reported seen sparse sheens off shore. They describe  them as literally \"evaporating before our eyes.\" Heavy rains and wind were the weather  of the day.  The SSC was contacted by the Coney Island Aquarium concerning the possibility of  gasoline entering their water intakes. They were assured that the fuel would not travel  that far.  The SSC converted the video footage from the previous days overflight into a digital  format for distribution to the media and investigating agencies."

The barge was loaded  with 56,000 barrels (2,352,000 gallons) and had a draft of 17.9 feet. It struck a  rock charted at 18 feet mean low water. Due to the stage of the moon, falling  tide, and offshore winds the water depth over the rock was minimal. The tug was  hugging the CT coast to stay in the lee of winds from the NW as it headed to its  destination in Port Jefferson, NY. The barge was taken to a nearby location (41deg  02.6 N / 73deg 22.053 W) and anchored.  The NOAA Scientific Support Team provided the USCG initial trajectory and oil  weathering information, weather, tides, and resources at risk summary.  At about 0800 the CT Department of Aquaculture closed the shellfish beds in all  waters in the Norwalk, Darien, and Westport area until further notice.  The divers survey discovered 14 cracks and holes in all six starboard tank  bottoms. The original estimate of cargo loss by the naval architect was 450  barrels (18,900 gallons).   Two morning overflights (0900 and 1200) by USCG personnel spotted an oil slick  extending several miles from the barge.   A relief barge arrived along side the holed barge at about 1400.   At 1600 the SSC, RP rep and USCG FOSC went on an overflight in a helicopter. A  sheen consisting of light rainbow to silver and gray was observed several miles  from the barge. It measured about 3.5 miles long by 200 yards wide at the leading  edge and 600 yards wide at the trailing end. The rest of LI Sound was search and  not other oil was located. The overflight also mapped locations of ice along the  LI coastline. A new trajectory model was developed based on the GPS positions of  the slick.  With the updated oil trajectory model showing land impacts on the northern Long  Island coast plans were made to pre-position protective boom as several location  near identified sensitive areas.  By the evening meeting at 1800 the revised estimate of lost oil was downgraded to  about 53 barrels (2,226 gallons). This estimate was within the range of oil  observed on the afternoon overflight.  Plans were made to begin over-the-top lightering operation during the first  night, but due to logistics and operational constraints they were unable to begin  until later the morning of the 15th.   On 2/15 the morning overflight only spotted one small streamer of light silver  and gray sheen within the area predicted by the trajectory model. The stern  starboard quarter of the barge was seen to be awash. No oil was observed near the  barge or anywhere near the LI coast. Almost all of the oil had evaporated and  naturally dispersed.  The NOAA modelers were requested to provide a ?Worst Case Discharge\" trajectory  for a possible release from the barge on Saturday evening or Sunday morning. The  new model indicated potential land impacts on LI more westerly than the oil that  was initially released.  Based on the updated weather forecasts for significantly worsening weather, the  Unified Command decided to move the barge into Bridgeport harbor for safe haven  to make temporary repairs and off-load the cargo. At present, as of 1800 this  evening (2/15) the barge is in route to Bridgeport. Travel time is anticipated to  be about 5 hours at two knots. Contingency plans are prepared for the possibility  of spills while enroute or in Bridgeport harbor."

    "description": "The SSC was notified of the initial impacts on Tuesday afternoon. It was reported as scattered tarballs along a 10 -- 12 mile stretch of the NJ ocean beaches from Manisquan Inlet to Seaside Heights. The SSC recommended that overflights and SCAT patrols look on the inside of the coastal inlets, as oil might have migrated inside the bay areas on incoming flood tides. Cleanup recommendations and bird recovery and rehabilitation strategies were also discussed. The NOAA Damage Assessment Coordinator was also notified. The NMFS noted that a number of seals (Harbor, harp, hooded, and grey) may be in the area. So far there have been about 20 birds affected (both dead and for rehab). Species include cormorants, ganets, seagulls, and red-throated loons. Manual cleanup operations were underway. With the impending storm cleanup efforts were focused on removal of the gross oil (larger tarballs and patties). Assessments after the storm passes were made to determine the need for further cleanup. There has been no identified source of the oil. The USCG Districts 1 and 5 have passed the word to all units to be on the lookout for any suspect vessels. Samples of the tarballs have been sent to the USCG Oil Identification Lab in Groton, CT for fingerprinting. The SSC brought up the point that the source may also be one of the many sunken tankers off the coast. USCG aircraft expanded their search further offshore in an attempt to spot any subsurface sources. There had been fairly high local media interest both in the New York and Philadelphia areas as well as from local NJ community press. NOAA trajectory modelers investigated the possibility of performing a hindcast to determine where the source of the oil may have likely originated. This was difficult and depend on the ability of the NWS to provide accurate local weather data for the last 10 days, as well as good current data."

During the evening, the Coast Guard discovered that sea water and oil had entered the ship's cargo hold, but no sheen was visible in the water near the vessel.  The ship was ballasted to reduce movement and damage overnight.  A weather forecast was provided to the Miami Marine Safety Office that indicated onshore winds through the weekend with a significant velocity increase on Sunday, 10 March.  An initial trajectory analysis indicated that any release of oil would likely move toward shore to the west fairly quickly ; within 2-3 hours.  If all 6500 gallons of oil were released, it would likely create a sheen visible for 2-3 miles which would spread  towards the west.  Shoreline staining from the diesel would not be likely beyond 2 miles from the point of release.  Oiled debris, seagrass and sargasm may need to be cleaned from the beach.  With diesel, localized and short term toxic effects would be of concern.  USCG district 7."

USCG ACTNY responded to the notification form the vessel. MBTE is a listed hazardous material. Therefore, the response activities were conducted under CERCLA authority and funding.  It was estimated that the ship had lost 350 barrels (14,700 gallons), and was leaking at about 9,000 gallons per hour. Due to the flammability of the product, the USCG set up an initial safety zone of one-half mile around the ship. Slowly that was reduced to 200 yards and then 100 yards. Eventually they were able to get Investigators aboard and do damage surveys. The crew began internal transfer of cargo out of the damaged tank. By 1830 the hole was plugged and by 0030 a temporary repair was made. It was estimated that a total of 588 barrels (25,000 gallons) was lost.  USCG district 1."

At 2300 the PRO requested trajectory support for a estimated 2,500 gallon gasoline spill. The tank vessel Fossanger reported a pin-hole leak in its #8 tank. That tank held 8,000 barrels and the vessel contained a total of 250,000 barrels. Within an hour the SSC had notified the Duty Officer, spoken with MASS and received a trajectory (See message #02).   During the evening hours the CG requested a diver's survey of the hull, however, the ship was in too shallow water and too close to the dock to get a diver in to check it out the hull condition or location of the leak.  At about midnight the SSC had discussions with the PRO about precautionary booming of sensitive areas. Over night protective boom was place in front of Pralls Island (sensitive area identified in the ACP) as a precaution.  The following morning the USCG ASTNY reported no oil seen on a first light overflight or by a boat crew in the Kills.  USCG district 1."

NOAA was asked to assess the trajectory implications of this release.  The SSC notified and consulted with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and NOAA's Damage Assessment and Restoration Program (DARP).  In general, given the current wind and sea conditions, the spilled oil is no threat to shoreline resources and should dissipate rapidly through evaporation and natural dispersion.  DARP's spill coordinator is assessing potential injury to the offshore marine environment.   Unless the situation changes, this report ends NOAA HAZMAT's response activities.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "At 1500 yesterday afternoon (31 Oct.) a barge that had been used to remove diesel fuel from a Navy vessel in a dry dock was damaged and some volume of diesel was released into the Elizabeth River in downtown Norfolk.  Most of the released diesel was reported to have been captured by a boom at Metro Machine's floating dry-dock.  At 1700 hours NOAA received a call from MSO Hampton Roads about the spill and provided weather, tides, and a trajectory forecast for where the diesel might go if the oil escaped from the boom.  This NOAA forecast suggested that the diesel would move with the Southerly wind and with the tide out of the harbor - maybe as far as Craney Island - and if the release was constant maybe as far as the mouth of the James River by 1 November.  This morning the Port of Hampton Roads has very heavy fog and no over flights were conducted.  However, the spill is reported by MSO Hampton Roads to be mostly contained in the boom and cleanup is progressing satisfactorily.  The Coast Guard had suggested that skimmers might be more efficient than using lots of sorbant pads, but these cleanup method decisions are for areas within the boom in an industrial area of the Elizabeth River near the floating dry docks.  It is believed that when the sun comes out during the afternoon of 1 November very little oil will be observed at shoreline locations away from the boomed spill site.  USCG district 5."

    "description": "Early morning of September 24, 2001, a tanker truck owned by the H.O. Bouchard Company of Maine (no connection to the New York shipping company) drove off highway 137, north of Brooks, Maine (44? 28.96N  069? 08.70W) and rolled into Sanborn Pond.  The tank truck destroyed a maple tree and a summer cottage, the guard rail ripped into the side of the tank and approximately 5,500 gallons of heated number 6 oil flowed into the pond.  Sanborn Pond is an 87 acre, freshwater pond connected to Dutton Pond to the north and a small stream to the south.  There is a dam at the south end, restricting all but a small amount of flow through to the stream.  The shoreline is typical of Maine ponds during time of low water (Maine has received very little rain this summer, therefore the lakes and pond are one to two feet below their normal level) bedrock, mixed boulder/cobble, and emergent vegetation.  This pond also has a short section of riprap (along the highway) and of sand (in front of the destroyed cottage, likely installed by the owner).  USCG district 1."

The M/V New Amity, a tanker vessel, was holed and an estimated 138.5 cubic meters, or 36,600 gallons, of oil was released.  The leaking vessel was directed into Barbers Cut Port Facility.  NOAA was initially requested to provide weather and an oil trajectory as well as to begin to evaluate cleanup issues related to several oiled commercial vessels scheduled to leave the port facility.  With respect to the latter, the use of surface washing agents as used in the Genmar Hector response was reviewed as an option to enhance cleanup.  USCG district 8."

The impacted area is a cypress swamp.  Rapid response by both the company and a hired response company (Oil Mop Inc.) resulted in the \"containment\" of most of the spilled oil in a canal system within 0.5 miles of the facility.  Oil in the containment area was greater than 0.5 inches thick in many locations.  High levels of benzene forced the responders to take a defensive approach, but by the end of the day, two shallow water skimmers were working the edge of the spill.

    "description": "Late in the evening of 15 May 2001, the NOAA SSC was notified by the HAZMAT Duty Officer of a chemical incident in South Texas.  The Texas Natural Resources and Conservation Commission (TNRCC) provide a \"heads up\" notification related to a facility fire and pesticide spill which occurred Friday night (11 May).  The situation was thought to be contained, but (apparently) an unknown connection existed between a storm water sewer and the City of East Bernard sewage treatment facility.  It is thought that some of the spilled chemical was lost to the San Bernard River by this route.  The pesticides released were Guthion 2L and Bidrin-8.  These chemicals are highly toxic to fish.  Release volumes were estimated at only 250 pounds.  A fish kill has been observed to extend 20 miles downstream as of this morning (16 May).  While the incident occurred some 50 miles from the coastal zone, it appears that coastal resources are threatened.  USCG district 8."

After the barge departed workers at the TOSCO facility discovered oil around their piers. They initiated a clean-up and notified the US Coast Guard Activities New York. The T/B Rhode Island meanwhile went to anchorage off New Haven, CT and Areas had to be cleaned several times as oil continued to wash on shore for several days. Primary clean-up end point was determined to be when all affected areas are unaffected by two tide cycles.  Primary clenup was successfully concluded on the 12th day. No re-oiling on 3 April, and all areas met the two tide cycle criteria. Operations were transferred to a monitor, response and remediation standards to potential reports of re-oiling by either the CG, NYS DEC or the public.  commenced lightering operations. On 23 March, the Marine Safety Office Field Station Coram starts receiving reports of thick, black oil washing up on beaches covering 25 miles on the north shore of Long Island, NY. The Coast Guard response team discovered a four-foot swath of oil at the high tide line at West Meadow Town Beach. Oil was confirmed from Sunken Meadow State Park to Wading River, NY. The Group/Marine Safety Office Long Island Sound (GRU/MSO) identified the T/B Rhode Island had an eight inch by one and one half-inch crack in the hull. The National Response Corporation (NRC) was hired to conduct manual shoreline cleanup. A unified Command was started consisting of the USCG, NY DEC, and Moran.  The weather initially was, winds from the NW at 15-20 knots.  Wednesday, north winds at 10-15 knots are predicted to shift and be from the W-SW at 10-15 knots by the afternoon hours.  Waves:  The seas were forecast to be 1-2 feet.  Precipitation:  No precipitation was predicted.  Ceiling/Visibility:  Clear skies were forecast.  Visibility expected to be unrestricted.  Temperature:  Throughout this forecast, temperatures are expected to range from highs in the 40's to lows in the 20's.  The GRU/MSO obtained samples from the barge and from the beach and had them tested by the Central Oil Identification Laboratory (COIL). The results were a positive match.

At risk is a highly sensitive area just south of this location identified as Swan Lake, Lower Galveston Bay, and the Bolivar Roads area.  What is unknown based on the available charts is if a connection between Swan Lake and Texas City Canal exist.  If so, Swan Lake is clearly at risk.  Verbal reports from the USCG suggest that there is no connection.  The spilled oil is reported to be a Kuwait Crude.  Such oils have a relatively light specific gravity, but readily emulsify.

One barge owned by Kirby Marine carried 27,000 bbl of NAPTHA, and was holed and leaking.  The initial report suggest a loss of 2,500 bbl, but this estimate was down-graded to between 800-1000 bbl actually lost to the sea from the double-hulled barge by 0730 hrs.  The spilled product was characterized as heavy, straight run naptha with a boiling point of >65?C and a density of 0.788 relative to pure water.  A MSDS provided indicated that the product contained 1% BENZENE.  NOAA was requested to provide scientific support and a trajectory forecast.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "The NOAA SSC was notified by MSU Galveston of an explosion on a jack-up rig in Galveston Block A109 at 1929 hrs, 13 January 2001.  Since the event had just happen, the initial report was sketchy and limited to the location (29? 08.57' N Lat. 094? 40.20' W Long.), vessel name (Bonita), and preliminary situation (explosion - details unknown).  The NOAA SSC contacted the HAZMAT Duty Officer who arranged for \"Home Team\" scientific support.  Given the high probability of loss of diesel fuel and lube oils on board the vessel and the possibility of an uncontrolled well blow-out, the SSC requested that the event be addressed as a potential major release. \tWeather forecast and trajectory implications were developed by the NOAA HAZMAT Home Team and verbally communicated to the USCG.  Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.  Any diesel fuel released would not persist more than a couple of miles from the release point due to the chemical nature of diesel oil and relative high seas (4-5').  The SSC also consulted with the Texas State SSC relative to trajectory implications.   \tAt approximately 2100 hrs, the USCG called to update the situation:  The lift boat did explode.  The cause of the explosion is still under investigation.  Six people were injured (broken bones and burns), but at this point, no fatalities.  The sub-sea safety valve was shut preventing any release from the well, and the well was reported to only be producing water at the time of the explosion.  This is still preliminary information, but the USCG was confident that there was no apparent well release based on confirming observations from a USCG vessel on-scene.  The lift boat was damaged, but the fuel tanks were reported to be intact.  Given the updated situation and the low probability of shoreline impacts from any minor release, the NOAA team is standing-down, but remains on stand by.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "The NOAA SSC was notified by MSO Houston of a chemical spill at approximately 1830 hours last evening (11 Jan.).  The spill was the result of heavy rains and a \"weak\" containment dike (this is a simplified characterization of the problem).  One report estimated 35,000 lbs of phosphoric acid diluted into a \"million\" gallons of water was released into a small ditch which eventually emptied into the Houston Ship Channel.  A verbal assessment of the behavior of the chemical and possible risks was provided after contacting Dr. Ed Overton at LSU for his chemistry prospective and a review of the CAMEO data.   \tWater monitoring had already began using a pH meter.  The verbal results passed to the SSC indicated that the ditch was at pH 2 (bottom of the acid scale).  However, within 40 feet of entering the ship channel, the values were neutral or background.  These may have only been surface readings, so a recommendation was made that a bottom pH profile be taken.  This is because concentrated solutions of phosphoric acid are more dense than water and would initially sink.  Source control had reduced addition drainage from the site to a \"trickle.\"   A fish kill is possible (probable).  A similar release in the same location, but of a much larger volume (45,000,000 gallons), was reported to have caused a major fish kill in 1992.   A cleanup contractor is on-scene and neutralizing the ditch water with lime.  John Kern, NOAA DAC, has been in contact with the state resource managers who are conducting a survey this AM.

The well location was reported at 29 degrees 37' 42.92\" N Lat. and 91 degrees 04' 33.77\" W Long. and adjacent to the ICW.  NOAA was requested to provide weather and plume trajectory support.    The initial report suggested that a well pressure surge had resulted in the well head blow-out preventor structure and secondary distribution valves (a.k.a. the Christmas Tree) being blown off followed by the well \"bridging-over.\"  Bridging-over is a term which refers to sand or other debris filling pore spaces around the well bore in the formation essentially shutting-off or reducing flow.  At first light, no gas was reported escaping from the well and only approximately 2 barrels of oil were observed in the water.  The source was characterized as a 9.5/8 casing which was producing at 15,000 psi.  A one mile safety zone was immediately established and the ICW closed.  The NOAA SSC responded on-scene and briefed the USCG Port Captain on the information provided by the NOAA Scientific Support Team in Seattle, WA (the Home Team).  As more information became available, the probable cause of the incident shifted to an explosion of a gas drying system immediately adjacent to the well head.  The explosion knocked off the Christmas tree, but immediately (with 5-10 seconds) the subsurface safety system engaged shutting in the line and preventing further release of gas and oil (the system worked as designed).  Wild well control specialist were brought in to install addition safety valves.  At noon, the well was classified as under control, and the ICW was again opened.  USCG district 8."

The next high tide is predicted for approximately 2249 CST tonight.  With the tide ebbing through the night and early morning hours and combined with offshore winds, the potential for any further shoreline impact in the near future is minimal.  Seas in the area remain relatively heavy, but the NOAA C-MAN station very near this location is reporting a reduction in wind velocity.  Heavy rains in the area my also lessen the affect of flood tides pulling diesel into the Sabine Lake area.  NOAA agreed to provide a follow-up assessment in the AM.  USCG district 8."

Further investigations revealed the spill had originated from an old unknown above ground storage tank hidden back in heavy underbrush along a steep shoreline at a long abandoned herring reduction plant site at New Port Walter (NPW) Cove.   The NPW Cove herring plant site is about 1.2 miles by water from the LPW station and roughly one-half  mile along the north shoreline inside BPW.

The location was reported 5 - 6 miles off Bolivar Peninsula, east of Galveston Texas, at 29? 26.25' N by 94? 25.33' W.  The maximum fuel capacity of the vessel is 3,000 gallons of diesel.  The vessel wasn't at max. fuel capacity and some of the diesel burned prior to sinking; 3000 gallons is being used as a worst case discharge volume.  The shallow shelf off Texas is an active fish habitat for white shrimp and a various finfish.  Sea turtles are also known to visit the area.  USCG district 8."

Upon seizure, the vessel was directed to Dutch Harbor, where it was turned over to NMFS which wanted the refrigeration system, containing 7000 lbs of ammonia, remediated before taking the vessel to Seward.  NOAA HAZMAT become involved when MSD Unalaska contacted the NOAA SSC in Anchorage for advice on whether a water or air release of this ammonia was better.  The vessel is in good mechanical condition, and can sail under its own power.  The systems on the vessel are generally in good working order, a fact that was confirmed when MSD Unalaska transmitted several digital photos of the refrigeration system.  The question of a potential release was put to experts at NOAA HAZMAT in Seattle, as well as to A.J. St. Germain, a member of the CG Pacific Strike Force team with considerable experience dealing with these issues.  After a round-table email discussion among these folks and ammonia experts with the UNOCAL urea plant in Nikiski, serious questions were raised about the possible effects and the need for any release of the ammonia, whether in water or in the air.  In the end, it was determined that the risks of releasing the ammonia were greater than the risks of leaving the ammonia intact aboard the vessel while it was transitted to Seward.  Crew members aboard the Arctic Wind were fully advised of the situation and the need to be on the look-out for any possible ammonia leaks in transit.  The vessel was successfully escorted to Seward with no further problems.  USCG district 17."

    "description": "On April 19, the F/V Starrigaven, a 59-ft fishing vessel tied unmanned to the Adak docks in Sweeper Cove on Adak Island, was blown loose from its moorings and grounded on the south side of the bay on a rocky shoreline.  Initially there was no pollution, as the steel hull of the vessel seemed to hold up against its rough landing surface.  The vessel contained 2000 gals of diesel.  Initial attempt to off load the fuel into barrels was not successful due to heavy weather conditions.  Instead, the vessel was anchored , tied down, and all vents plugged to prevent any further movement of the vessel and possible release of fuel.  By April 22, conditions were calm enough and the tide was higher, that the vessel was refloated and brought back over to the Adak docks, all the while being boomed.  Some minor holes did occur in the hull, and an estimated 80 gallons of diesel were released at the grounding site.  At the Adak docks, divers surveyed the hull and found numerous scrapes, indents, and cracks, all of which would have to be repaired.  USCG district 17.  Keyword: fishing vessel, diesel."

At 11:52 April 11, 2000 MSO Chicago called for a sediment sampling plan to assist them in determining the source and extent of tarballs that had shown up in the Burns Ditch just West of Burns Harbor Indiana.  The tarballs were collected by MSO Chicago and underwent analysis for composition.  It was found that these tar balls were made up of several oils and animal fat and were termed by industry as \"Bear Fat\".  These oils were typically used as lubrication on rollers for the Steel Industry.  A cleanup contractor was called up to provide crews to rake and shovel the scattered tar balls within the area.

The ships manifest indicates that this container carried one hundred and thirty 150# chlorine cylinders, two 2,000# chlorine cylinders and several empty oxygen cylinders.  After arriving at Guam on 3/21, the vessel maintained position off Apra Harbor.  A shuttle transported CG pollution investigators and a hazmat team to board the vessel.  A Level B entry made by Island Equipment personnel (owner of chlorine cylinders) identified the presence of chlorine vapor by using ammonia spray and the presence of a hissing noise.

The spill was the result of a decoupling (pipe separation) at Mississippi Canyon 538 (N 28? 23.32 Lat. W 89? 27.12 Long.).  The spill volume is reported as 240 bbl.  The spill was reported at 1415 hrs CST and source control by reattachment of BOP was reported at 1800 hrs.  The spilled oil is relatively heavy with an API of only 20.2.  Such oils are generally persistent and often form emulsified oil patties and tarballs which can travel long distances.  Often oil released under such conditions is already emulsified with formation or production water.  Dispersants are being evaluated, but would not be practical for a highly emulsified oil.  Conditions off-shore are good for mechanical recovery, and two skimmers are heading to the location.  Given the distance off-shore, landfall is not predicted over the next 2-3 days.

Originally it was believed that the vessel was on soft bottom just inside a spit extending from the eastern entrance to Icy Bay.   However, divers discovered that the ship's aft portion was resting on a flat rock.  After removing  much of the log cargo, the initial attempt to refloat the vessel occurred on the lower high tide, the evening of February 26 using the two small tugs that were available at the logging camp.    This effort was unsuccessful.  Two larger tugs, dispatched from Juneau, and were due to arrive on-scene the morning of February 27.   Due to crew fatigue and the two larger tugs not being in position, no attempt was made on the morning higher high tide on February 27.   Efforts to refloat the vessel was planned for the morning of a higher high tide on February 28.  With the vessel fully lightered of logs and the tugs pulling, the Pacsun was successfully refloated on this tide.    No pollution occurred.

One of the barges in the tow, Hollywood 2019, was holed and released an estimated 150 bbl of \"BTEX-Raffinate.\"  The spilled product is a light petroleum distillate dominated by hydrocarbons between nC-4 and nC-8 (much like gasoline).  The incident occurred near beacon 42 in the Houston Ship Channel.  The tow was moved to near beacon 53.  MSO Houston is responding. \tAt 1840 hrs (CST), the NOAA SSC was alerted of the spill by the NOAA Hazmat Duty Officer.  The SSC linked up with MSO Houston and is providing technical support to include trajectory and weather information.  The preliminary trajectory suggests that Dickerson Bay near April Fool's Point may be at risk, but if the volume released is only 150 bbl, the potential for land-fall is low.  The spilled product will most likely be lost by a combination of evaporation and dispersion during the evening and night.  USCG district 8."

A mayday rousted a helicopter from the deck of the USCG Mellon, and successfully removed the crew of five from the burning  vessel.   At this point, the unmanned vessel was only a few miles offshore and the wind was 30 knots from the southeast  blowing it towards a grounding on the southeast side of Unimak Island.   With rocky shores to roughly one mile either side, the vessel grounded in the afternoon on a sand and gravel beach.  The steel hull remained intact, and no pollution was observed.  Then began a month long dance with the weather as the salvor, Dan Magone from Dutch Harbor, tried several times to reach the vessel only to be thwarted by the weather and  high seas.  Finally large bladders were flown in by the Coast Guard, and the salvor successfully pumped the fuel and removed the drums from the vessel, with no pollution to the environment.    NOAA provided support to the USCG by keeping track of the weather and weather forecasts, and by coordinating information from the resource agencies on sensitivities in the vicinity.  Grounding occurred only one mile from the mouth of the Lazaref River, a salmon spawning stream where there may be chum and/or pink salmon eggs in the intertidal gravels.   Other information from the USFWS indicated that loose concentrations of waterfowl including Steller's eiders (threatened species), scoters, emperor geese, and cormorants had been observed in the vicinity only 3 days earlier.

The spill was first reported on 5 February on the edge of a 120 acre pond on the refuge. The source of the spill was a break in a miter bend in the pipe, which was estimated to be at least 50 years old. The product spilled was a blend of Cabinda and Escravos crudes with API of 32-34 and the total spill volume is unknown. The pond was covered with ice and snow. The edge of the oil under the ice was delineated, then the ice was cut to place a boom outside that area to prevent further spread of the oil.  Over the period of 5-28 February an estimated 173,000 gallons of oil have been recovered (the volumes have been corrected for water content). The pond has been ice-free for over a week, and most of the free-floating oil has been recovered. What remains for cleanup is oil trapped along the pond shoreline and on the adjacent hardwood swamp, and contaminated soils in the pipeline corridor. The pond shoreline is composed of a vertical scarp in clay or undercut scarp, with abundant exposed roots.  USCG district 5."

    "description": "On 25 February Coast Guard MSO New Orleans received a report that four gasoline tank barges pushed by the M/V Melinda Brent allided with the Simmesport R/R bridge located at mile marker 4.9 on the Atchafalaya River.  The four barges had broken loose from the towboat and three were fully involved in fire.  An unknown amount of gasoline was leaking into the river.  Barges are lashed together and are located at mile 14.5.  Total product onboard the four barges was 70,000 bbl (2,940,000 gallons) of gasoline.  NOAA was asked to provided scientific support relative to possible fate scenarios and resources at risk.  The river was at normal-to-low water levels, and well within its banks.  Therefore, the resources of greatest risk are those in the river itself.  Gasoline is expected to completely evaporate, so the risk to aquatic resources is from acute toxicity from exposure to the highly soluble toxic fractions and near the source.  Transport down river was not expected to be uniform.  Gasoline could collect in eddies and oxbows, and present a potential for downstream localized hazards.  In these collection areas, the gasoline could also absorb to available organic material.  In addition, a local toxic shock to biota in shallow nearby areas was possible.  Pallid sturgeon (a listed endangered species) were present in the river, but were predicted to be concentrate at the control structure (upstream of the release site and not at significant risk).  Other rare species thought present in the river at the time of the incident were paddlefish and blue suckers.  These fish are highly mobile able to avoid exposures that would result in death.  Exceptions might be to juvenile fish in shallow areas close to the shoreline.  The greatest risk was to the commercial fishery.  An estimated 25-30 commercial fishermen worked the stretch threatened.  Commercial fisheries at risk included buffalo, freshwater drum, and several species of catfish.  Other resources present in the area included eagles and wading bird colonies.  For two days the barges were allowed to burn.  When the fire significant subsided, fire suppression experts attached the fire with water and foam.  The barges were then allowed to cool and possible reignition minimized by a foam blanket.  All barges were lightered and moved off scene by the evening of 28 February.  Only a \"negligible amount\" of gasoline was thought lost downstream.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "At 1159 CST on Friday, 22 January 2000. the NOAA SSC was notified of an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico off the Louisiana coast.  The location of the spill was 60 miles offshore.  The spill resulted when an anchor from a semi-submersible drilling rig dragged across and damaged a 24\" pipeline at both the impact site and at a platform more than a mile away.  Oil was released from both locations.  The water depth was greater than 400 feet.  The initial release volume, based on the amount of oil transferred between the time of the incident and shut in was 1839 bbl.  The line was owned by Equilon Pipeline and identified as part of the Poseidon Pipeline System.  The NOAA SSC relocated to the Shell Command Post at the request of the USCG to support the on-scene incident commander.  Preliminary trajectories suggested that the oil would move west and north.  Landfall was not predicted for several days.  The type of oil was a medium sour crude with an API gravity of 31.5.  Such oils may form persistent tarballs and be transported long distances.  Skimmers were activated.  Given the potential for environmental injury from the spill, dispersants were evaluated and approved under the RRT6 preapproval guidelines by the COTP Morgan City.  The sea state (10-15 knot winds and 4-5 foot seas) was ideal for oil dispersion.  Between 1530 CST and dusk, a total of 3000 gallons were applied (1000 gallons by DC-3 and 2000 gallons by DC-4).  The SMART team from USCG Gulf Strike Team was launched and provided visual monitoring.  Observers clearly observed a dispersant plume and not just surface herding.  It was estimated that 75% of the surface oil had been dispersed.  Dispersant operations ended due to darkness.  During the evening and night, overflights were conducted with both IR and SLAR to maintain contact with the oil.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "At approximately 3:15 AM on 24 Nov. 1999, a pipeline release occurred just east of East Grand Terre Island off Barataria Bay, Louisiana.  The cause of the release is still under investigation.  Between 850 and 1200 bbls of a deep well production oil was released.  The oil was identified as MARS Blend, a relatively high sulfur, low asphaltene crude oil.  The initial trajectory predicted the oil would move south of Four Bayous pass and sustained north winds would move most of the oil offshore.  The winds were less than the forecast and the spill coincided with a spring tide (not the season Spring, but the description of the time in the tide cycle characterized by the greatest high and low tides, derived from spring up or rise).  Much of the oil moved back into Four Bayous and Barataria Pass.  The next morning.  Heavy concentrations of oil were observed on shorelines and on water.  The NOAA SSC participated in a morning overflight (pre-SCAT survey) on Thanksgiving morning to delineate oiled shorelines and surface oil.  Heavy surface oil concentrations north of Grand Terre and south of Four Bayous Pass were identified and skimmers repositioned.  Heavy oil was observed on the barrier islands of Barataria Bay.  The barrier islands impacted were Elmer's Island, Grand Isle, Grand Terre, and East Grand Terre.  The latter two were the heaviest impacted and the most remote (no road access).  Stranded oil was heaviest near the passes and on the eastern end of each island.  At least one marina at Grand Isle was impacted. \tBy Friday (two days after the spill), overflights looked encouraging.  Very little oil was visually observed on the beaches and on-water sheens were significantly reduced; unfortunately, most of the oil was buried by depositional sand and the lower tide level was preventing remobilization of stranded oil.   \tThe SCAT team used the aerial pre-SCAT survey to aid shoreline assessments since the heavily oiled beach areas were previously identified, but now mostly hidden by over-laying sand.  SCAT was an essential element in the response and used by the Unified Command to define areas which required cleanup as well as monitoring cleanup activities to insure that the cleanup recommendations were both adequate and adhered to by field crews.  More than 100 cleanup works were engaged in this response.  Cleanup objectives and endpoints were developed within the SCAT organization.  SCAT recommendations developed a balance between preserving beach sand (a valued state resource) and minimizing potential environmental threats.  \t \tAt the end of the day (Sunday, 28 Nov.), only five sites are still being cleaned.  Of particular interest are a small marsh on the interior of East Grand Terre and a Gobi revetment (riprap) along the Conoco facility on the north side of Grand Isle (see Hotline #15 pictures, EGT and GIC, respectively).  Both sites contain free oil.  Both sites present unique cleanup problems.  The interior marsh is highly isolated and composed of very soft sediments which restrict access without causing environmental injury.  Each of the Gobi blocks is an Ãegg crate-like\" structure with spaces which hold trapped fluid oil.  USCG district 8."

Initially, the USN reported to the National Response Center that 1,000 gallons of fuel had been spilled.  Soon after that report, the amount was updated to 20,000 gallons and then to 100,000 gallons.  The official spillage finally was determined to be 112,000 gallons.  The oil flowed from the day tank into an underground drainage pipe, which runs under a runway and several roads for several hundred yards.  The pipe empties into an open drainage ditch, which drains to a 29-acre mangrove forest.  This forest drains through a culvert into Ensenada Honda Bay (a.k.a.: Ensenada Bay).  The USN's primary environmental concern was the bay.  In the face of an approaching hurricane, USN Construction Battalion (a.k.a.: Sea Bees) personnel constructed a dam or plug at the culvert between the first impacted mangrove (later named \"mangrove A\") and the mangrove adjacent to the bay (later named \"mangrove C\").

The discharge was estimated to be about 500 gallons.  The product source was from a storm drain, rather than a pipeline, and was traced back to the parking garage of an apartment complex that maintains an oily water separator to treat natural seeps from the La Brea tarpits.  The separator has been inoperable for sometime, thereby allowing the discharge of oily water into the storm drain system that leads out to Ballona Creek.  The source of the leak has been secured and cleanup operations are underway.  So far, about 7 miles of storm drain pipe and about 4 miles of creek are impacted.  An overflight yesterday morning confirmed that no sheen or product has exited the creek.  USCG district 11."

A spill of 115 bbl was caused by an act of vandalism on an above ground, 2\" crude oil pipeline.  Apparently, the line was cut with a hacksaw.  The spill is relatively contained in an adjacent canal and freshwater marsh.  Mechanical recovery is being effective using water herding and MARCO and drum-type skimmers.  The cleanup is complicated by a large quantity of water hyacinth which are also entrained with the oil.  Buddy Goatcher, USFWS is responding relative to waterfowl protection, and the Louisiana DEQ and Oil Spill Coordinator's Office have been on-scene.  The SSC was requested to visit the site to discuss final cleanup issues and the potential use of bioremediation if appropriate.  The SSC (Henry) is planning to be on-scene Sunday morning, 3 October.

The spill was in the bay just offshore the village of Mekoryuk on the north side of Nunivak Island.  The reason for the release was uncertain, however, the USCG was informed that the fuel in the barge was being transferred to other intact tanks.  The USCG also learned that the barge crew had deployed a boom around the spill and were in the process of skimming.  The total amount of fuel onboard was 78,000 gallons  This area is part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) administered by the USFWS. The combination of skimming, evaporation, and natural dispersion soon eliminated the problem and no resources were impacted.

    "description": "In the early morning hours of 29 September 1999, the F/V LORENTINE III sank while being towed towards Sabine Pass, TX.  The vessel sank in 30 feet of water, 6-8 miles west of the pass entrance.  The vessel was reported to have approximately 7000 gallons of diesel fuel oil and 30 gallons of lube oil onboard.  The amount released was unknown.  Subsequent USCG overflights observed no visible sheens associated with the fishing vessel.  Since no sheens were observed, there was reason to suspect that a majority of the diesel fuel was still on-board.  The USCG considered the sunken vessel a hazard to both navigation and the environment.  While diesel is generally considered a nonpersistant oil with a relatively high evaporation rate and natural dispersion rate, most diesel fuel oils are, at the same time, highly toxic.  The NOAA SSC was asked to provide information to assess potential spill trajectories and possible environmental affects related to the sunken fishing boat.  NOAA also provided an evaluation of potential damages under possible spill scenarios using the Type A Model.  This information was used to develop both a response strategy and a cost-benefit analysis related to salvage operations and cost.  Using the information provided by NOAA, the MSO was able to develop and negotiate a cost effective salvage plan.  The diesel fuel was pumped off the vessel eliminating the environmental hazard.  The evaluation process developed during the F/V LORENTINE III response became a template for future similar responses off the Texas/Louisiana coast.  USCG district 8."

The freighter Blue Master suffered two gashes 1 and 2 meters above the waterline and along a tank containing IFO 180 (a bunker-type fuel oil).  Oil was in the water.  Initial estimates of the volume released ranged between 50 and 315 barrels (110 barrels was the final estimate).  Given the persistence of heavy fuel oil, the threat to coastal resources, and the potential for shoreline oiling, dispersants were considered.  After an afternoon overflight, more oil was discovered.  Based on this and previous observations it was decided to use dispersants.  At approximately 1830, a DC-4 arrived and sprayed dispersant on the 3-nm by 5-m oil slick.  A total of 700 gallons of Corexit 9500 was applied to the slick.  An overflight August 30 showed a 4-mile long sheen, still 30 miles offshore.  Observation conditions were good light and absolutely calm seas.  No black oil was visible, only sheen. Visually it was difficult to determine efficacy (proof of action) because there was very little surface mixing energy, the rate of dispersion was predictably slow.  Tarballs were still a threat to the shoreline, but not for several days.  Special Monitoring of Advanced Response Technologies (SMART) was not deployed since it was logistically impossible to get the team on-scene in time  USCG district 8.

The vessel contained 60 metric tons of #2 fuel oil, 532 metric tons of IFO 180, and 25 metric tons of gas oil. At 1427 hours July 21the M/V Navios Pioneer floated off the bank under her own power.  She was inspected at her anchorage and no damage to her bottom plating was noted. The NOAA trajectory analysis suggested that the winds were 10-15 knots from the WSW and would becoming more westerly as the afternoon progressed.  The forecast was for more westerly wind 5-10 knots through Thursday.  Based on these winds and that the ship was 7 miles offshore, NOAA did not anticipate the tidal currents to be strong enough to pull any spilled oil into Port Royal Sound.  NOAA also suggested that any oil spill over the initial 24 hours of the grounding would move offshore and to the east of east southeast.  If significant amounts of the IFO 180 that was on board the vessel would have been lost, NOAA suggested that it could persists for a week or two and result in tarball impacts to the beaches 10's of miles from the grounding site depending on the wind conditions at the time.

The tug released an estimated 1200 gallons of fuel oil (the potential spill was estimated at 5000 gallons).  The area threatened by the spill included many very sensitive wildlife resource areas.  Birds were at the greatest risk of impact from this spill because they were present in very large numbers and many of the species present do not avoid oiled areas.  Species present at this time were: brown pelicans (federal, endangered species), a wide range of shorebirds (such as dunlins, sandpipers), wading birds (egrets, avocets, stilts), many species of terns, skimmers, gulls, and cormorants.  The piping plover (state and federal threatened) was also present..  There are two areas of very high bird concentrations: the Bolivar Flats area just north of the North Jetty, and Pelican Island.  Pelican Island is an important nesting area, with up to 11,000 royal terns, 5600 royal terns, and 21,000 laughing gulls nesting there.

    "description": "During the first week of May 1999, the USCG intercepted a Chinese fishing vessel illegally fishing in the Bering Sea and took it under escort to Adak Naval Station on Adak Island to deliver it to the National Marine Fishing Service (NMFS).  They have jurisdiction for fishing violations.  The USCG boarded the vessel and found a decrepit old ship, just an accident waiting to happen.  The fore fish hold was filled with diesel fuel, which although not a violation, was an extremely sloppy maritime practice.  The vessel was rusty, cramped, full of junk, and her systems were just barely in working order.  While in port, a serious ammonia leak occurred driving the crew out of the lower levels.  As a result of this chemical incident the USCG called in the Pacific Strike Team (PST).  The PST sent seven members on-scene and, outfitted in level B protective gear, began monitoring the levels of ammonia in the ship.   In several locations concentrations of several hundred ppm were measured, and since the IDLH for ammonia is 300 ppm, it was deemed a very serious situation. Not knowing how much ammonia was onboard, the PST decided to bleed off the system.  On the fourth level down in the ship, a 55-gallon drum of water and fans were set up to bleed the ammonia into.

On April 12, 1999, during the second search by the Air Training Center Mobile, the vessel was located in a position 21 nms southwest of Cape San Blas, Florida.  After repeated attempts to hail the vessel failed, a Good Samaritan (Sam) vessel volunteered to assist.  The Good Sam vessel arrived on-scene and reported that the Poseidon's nets were in the water, the running lights were energized, the generator was running, but there were no crew members visible on deck.  The Good Sam vessel was thanked for her help and released because the unknown situation could be dangerous. A USCG Station Panama City UTB was launched and directed to investigate the situation.  The UTB arrived on-scene, dispatched a boarding team to the vessel, and discovered three crewmembers lying in the hold apparently deceased.  The boarding team did not go into the hold for safety reasons.  USCG District Eight asked District Seven to transport two gas-free engineers from the Bay County Sheriff's Department to the vessel in their HH-60 from the Air Station (A/S) Clearwater.  The gas-free engineers were lowered to the vessel but were unable to access the hold due to their bulky equipment.  The fishing nets were cut loose and the vessel was towed to Panama City, Florida by the station UTB.  The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), MSD Panama City, Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS), and the local coroner were notified of the incident and met the vessel at the dock.  Once at the dock, the space was certified gas-free and the coroner pronounced the crewmembers deceased. An autopsy was performed.  Once the coroner was finished, the federal agencies began their investigation.  The actual cause of death was not initially known.  A preservative sodium meta-bisulfite was found in the hold.

No release of cargo or fuel bunkers was seen during the initial USCG overflight.  The vessel grounded on the Canadian side of the river, and for the most part, Canadian interests conducted the response efforts.  However, the grounding posed a high risk of contamination that would involve United States' efforts if a spill were to happen.  By day two, the vessel's Oil Spill Response Organization (OSRO) had boomed off the ship and lightering operations were underway. OSRO are many cleanup agencies or companies  that can be contracted by a vessel that has a U.S. port on its itinerary. The names of OSRO's are supplied to the vessel by the USCG to be used voluntarily to secure an agency to perform cleanup operations during the ship's transit in US waters.  The Canadians have a similar program but they are called simply ROs (Response Organizations).  The National Strike Team (NST) Coordination Center reviews each company that wishes to be included on the OSRO list.  They must meet certain criteria to be allowed as a response organization.  Once approved any vessel determines which OSRO will be suitable for their area of transit and what they are carrying.  Or they may contract an organization elsewhere to suit their's and the USCG's needs.  On day three the vessel was successfully pulled off and anchored for a hull inspection by divers.  There was no major damage to the vessel's integrity so she was allowed to steam to a dry dock facility for repairs.  The USCG monitored the situation. The ship is carrying a cargo of powdered cement and has 98.2 metric tons(105,000 gallons) of IFO 180 fuel oil and 98.2 metric tons(27,000 gallons) of diesel. No product has been spilled.

    "description": "Due to heavy seas on February 11, 1999, the F/B Seaspan Rigger, being pulled by the UTV Seaspan Commodore, lost her deck cargo of logs into the northeastern Gulf of Alaska (GOA) about 38 nautical miles (nm) west of Cape Spencer.  On-scene conditions were 55-knot winds, 30-foot seas, snow, icing conditions, and 1/4 nm visibility.  The quantity of logs was quite large-200 to 400 log bundles of 80 to 100 logs per bundle.  The logs were 41 to 45 feet long and 4 to 15 inches in diameter; each bundle weighed approximate 27 tons.  The USCG deemed these logs a hazard to navigation of TAPS tankers, container vessels, and maritime traffic in the GOA.  Initially the logs were in MSO Juneau's zone and, along with the Seventeenth District Coast Guard Operations Center in Juneau, requested that NOAA provide weather forecasts and predict trajectories of the logs to monitor the position of the logs help their C-130 overflights.  NOAA's initial report to the USCG was that the trajectory of the logs will continue west-southwest at 2% of the wind speed (0.5 knots) until they cross the 100-fathom curve where they will encounter the Alaska Current and begin moving in a west-northwest direction at approximately the same speed. Due to the severe weather, many of the log bundles broke apart making it very difficult for ships' radar to see this debris.  The weather was not cooperative and overflights could be conducted only every 3 to 5 days.  As location reports came in, they were forwarded to NOAA in Seattle who then used this information to provide a search location for the next overflight.  The Alaska Stream occupies this portion of the GOA and moves from east to west and the logs were gradually dispersed and carried west-northwest toward the central GOA.  As the logs moved west, MSO Valdez became involved in the tracking effort and served to coordinate information flowing to and from USCG Kodiak Air Station who was conducting the overflights.

    "description": "This spill occurred sometime after midnight on February 10, 1999,  when a 10-inch pipeline burst open on top of a hill overlooking Fort Loudoun Lake on the Tennessee River.   Phone calls soon began to filter into the local fire station describing a strong diesel smell within a cluster of homes at Scottish Pike in South Knoxville, Tennessee.   When a fire truck arrived on-scene, a fountain of diesel fuel was spewing heavily onto an adjacent house and an immediate evacuation of six homes took place.   At the same time notification to shut down its pipeline was given to Colonial Pipeline (RP).  They were also told to boom off Goose Creek, at the junction of the creek and the Lake.  The diesel had flowed down an embankment to Goose Creek then into the lake and river creating a slick 60 feet wide  and several miles long.  The USCG was notified and dispatched a team from MSD Nashville and three members of the USCG GST.  EPA arrived on-scene the morning of February 13 and assumed the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) position since the spill originated from shore.  The cause of the spill will be investigated by the National Transit Safety Board (NTSB).  The spill occurred at river mile (RM) 647.5, which is below the City of Knoxville's  water intakes.  Additionally the river is controlled by a dam ( Fort Loudoun Lake Dam) that shut down operations soon after notification of the spill.  By midmorning the RP and contracted response organizations had boomed off three locations down river.  Because it was dyed red the diesel produced a very noticeable slick. The current in the area was flowing at 1 knot and a little faster in the river bend just a couple of miles downstream from Goose Creek in the area called Sequoyah Hills.  From there the river opens up wider and the current drops off significantly.   As the diesel spread out, rainbow sheens developed.  This was prevalent between Sequoyah Hills and a mile down river to Looney Island.  As the spilled diesel weathered, silver sheens became more prevalent after day two and even more on day three.  Additionally silver steaks could be seen from the air  leeching off a point at RM 645.  South of Looney Island to Sequoyah Park the diesel was observed to be in streaks and patches.  On shore the diesel penetrated deep into the riprap shorelines and maybe an inch into the fine-grain sand shores from Goose Creek to Sequoyah Hills.  Oil film and a brown frothy mousse could be seen downstream of Sequoyah Hills. Additional shoreline impacts were at the booming site at Sequoyah Park where unweathered diesel pooled at the junction of the boom and shoreline.  Some oiled debris was located at RM 639 near Maxey's Boat Dock.  Fortunately half the area is guarded by bedrock bluffs resulting in less shoreline impact and probably accounted for a high percentage of recovery noted by the RP.  Officially, 45,000 gallons of diesel was released and 90% was recovered by skimmers and vacuum trucks.  The initial report of the spill indicated that there had been 80,000 gallons of diesel released.  In which case the mass balance breaks down to 50% recovered, 30% evaporated, 15% Goose Creek soils, and 5% other shoreline impacts.  USCG district 8.

Dispersants are being considered should the volume released be considered a significant nearshore and shoreline threat.   The rig is located approximately 70 miles offshore.  Preliminary assessment suggest that if the estimated volume released remains low (less than 100 bbl), environmental risk is low.  NOAA HAZMAT will develop a detailed trajectory and transport/fate analysis when information from the overflight is received.

The spilled oil was a condensate crude with an API of 38.  The stretch of shoreline from Galveston to Freeport is historically an area with high concentrations of birds.  In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.  However, because of the high concentrations of birds present in the area of the predicted impact, there was a risk of birds getting oiled.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: boom, Corexit 9500."

    "description": "At 0900 PST on February 4, 1999, the M/V New Carissa, a 639-foot bulk freight ship of Panamanian registry, went hard aground in heavy seas about 150 yards off a stretch of remote, undeveloped sandy beach three miles north of Coos Bay, Oregon. Heavy surf and high winds throughout the next several days made boarding the vessel difficult and dangerous. While the preferred option was to salvage the vessel with the oil on board, the Unified Command requested that contingency plans for vessel lightering, cleanup and pollution response be developed. The longer the ship remained grounded, the greater the risk of it leaking its load of nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Moreover, a small group of endangered snowy plover was located approximately 800 yards south of the vessel.  In fact, on February 8, shipboard personnel observed oil burping out alongside the ship from a small crack in the hull and on the beach near the ship.  On February 9, a tug tried to pull the ship off the beach. But by then winds and waves had driven the New Carissa approximately 600 feet further shoreward, beyond the operational reach of the salvage vessel and its ability to safely anchor near the surf zone. The bow section was towed and sunk on March 11, 1999 in 1,811 fathoms of water 282 nautical miles off the Oregon coast.  58 Federal, state, county, and local agencies took part in the month-long response. NOAA, Oregon Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Parks and Recreation, DOI Bureau of Land Management, U. S. Fish and Wildlife, U. S. Forest Service, Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area and South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve identified and prioritized sensitive environments potentially at risk.  A total of 537 birds died (239 oiled; no endangered snowy plovers), with 201 birds at the rehabilitation center (172 oiled; no snowy plovers) as of March 1999.  Media interest remains high.  Thirteen months after the spill, NOAA and the Coast Guard continue to maintain the following incident web sites, which contain public press release information, Coast Guard pollution reports, and digital photographs:  http://www.uscg.mil/d13/units/grunbend/airstation/grounding  http://www.uscg.mil/d13/dpa/news  As of March 8, 2000, these web sites had totalled over 45,800 hits.

    "description": "On December 29, 1998, a southbound Burlington Northern-Santa Fe train derailed at milepost 113  on the Mississippi River.  Several train cars entered the water but only one breached its contents of titanium dioxide into the environment.  Three other cars containing hazardous materials with a high degree of release potential were precariously mingled in wreckage. Of these three cars, two  contained sulfuric acid and the other one contained a mixture of pentane and isoprene.  Each car's capacity was 10,000 gallons.  At the time of the derailment, it was not clear what was in the water and several water intakes were closed until further investigation was conducted. Weather at the scene was calling for northwest winds of 15 to 20  knots, temperatures in the low 20s and a chance of snow.  The following morning there was an inventory taken and assessment made to verify that there was only titanium dioxide in the water.  The intakes were reopened and monitored throughout the operation.  The higher concerns were to stabilize the cars of sulfuric acid, pentane, and isoprene and to remove them from the area.  The railroad company quickly brought in heavy machinery to clear the wreckage.  A full crew worked around the clock in laying approximately 1 mile of new track.  Entry to the site was through private property where the RP negotiated a fair economic settlement  with the owner for access and staging equipment.  By day two, a salvage plan was submitted for those railroad cars in the water.  Two crane barges were sent up from St. Louis to unravel the wreckage and place the cars in isolated locations for transportation to a railroad port in St. Louis.  USCG district 2.

This is about 60 miles offshore of Sabine Pass and within a mile of the dividing line between two USCG response zones.  The vessels location is in MSD Lake Charles's Response Zone, but the oil quickly moved into MSU Galveston's Response Zone.  MSU Galveston requested an oil trajectory on 24 Nov. (see Hotline #2) and stated that overflights would be conducted by MSD Lake Charles.  The NOAA trajectory doesn't anticipate any landfall within the next three days (the duration of the trajectory forecast).  In general, given the type of oil, quantity spilled, and current offshore weather and ocean currents, the potential for observable beach oiling is very low.  Nearly half of the oil will evaporate and the rest will form small tarballs.  The later are very persistent and may travel many hundreds of miles, but will probably be so highly spatially dispersed that they will be virtually undetected.  They will be lost among the background tarball population of the Gulf of Mexico.  Tarballs in the Gulf of Mexico are derived from both natural seeps and anthropogenic spills.    NOAA SSC (Henry) will follow up and update the situation when more information is available.  USCG district 8."

The HCL car was leaking at an approximated rate of 10 to 20 gallons per minute.

No one seemed to know for sure which tank was affected or how big it was or how much diesel was released.   Gale force winds up to 45 knots hampered local assessment of the situation, so the USCG launched a helicopter from Kodiak to investigate the situation.   Approaching darkness and gale force winds hampered the helicopter, making it unable to land, but it did survey Chignik Lake, Chignik river, and Chignik lagoon.   A small area of sheen was located at the mouth of the lake and in the river but none in the lagoon.  It was impossible to determine the source point of the diesel or how much had been released.

The initial reported location was 28?59'N, 090?15'W at 1300 CDT.  The rig is reported to be dragging one of its \"legs\" and there is concern that it could damage submerged pipelines in the area.  No pollution has been reported but strong winds, rough seas, and torrential rain in the Gulf of Mexico as a result of Tropical Storm Francis have restricted overflights and access to the rig.

As the severe weather continued, the early morning report suggested that the tug was unable to approach the Maria Teresa due to shoal water.  Salvage efforts and methods were discussed.  No proposals were developed during the early hours of the incident. Weather on-scene was such that salvage efforts were not able to be started until September 5.

A crew member discovered the hydrochloric acid, leaking from a 6-inch gash in the bottom of the car, while making a routine inspection of the cars at 9:12 a.m.  Cambridge fire officials first said the leak in the 66-thousand gallon white tanker car was caused by a train derailment. But when firefighters from the hazardous materials team got a close-up look, they determined that the tank split open because of a structural failure.  The tanker contained several compartments, preventing its entire contents from spilling.

The owner of the vessel reported that there may have been 150 gallons of diesel fuel onboard and hired a commercial salvor and diver from Foster Survey and Claims.  By the end of the day, the diver had plugged the fuel vents. There was a report that there was little sheening from the sunken vessel.  During the next few days, the winds remained from the north and northeast at over 10 knots with 2- to 3-foot seas.   During this time, salvage operations were not attempted and little sheen was observed coming from the vessel.  USCG district 5.  Keyword: none."

    "description": "A spill of Louisiana crude occurred from the tank barge CTCO-211  when she was holed in the #3 port tank in a collision with a raft of grain barges at 0245, June 17, 1998.  The barge, owned by Cenac Towing Co., had a capacity of 11,000 barrels.  It was estimated (by sounding) that approximately 1904 barrels  of Louisiana Light (API 41) was discharged into the Mississippi River at MM 179.  The barge was beached on the right descending bank.   For the next several days, salvors attempted to stabilize the barge, assess the extent of damage, and limit residual release.  There was great concern that the CTCO-211 may suddenly shift and damage the fully loaded barge that was grounded alongside her.  Oil from this release was seen as far down river as New Orleans.  Extensive surveys were made to check for oil migrating to the marshes at the mouth of the river, but no oil was detected.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: none."

The  Porpoise had brought the Atlantic into the Port of Wilmington and both vessels were moored at the Eagle Island terminal.    Initial reports from the crew of the Porpoise and her owners suggested that the Atlantic was only carrying \"clean ballast.\"  However, MSO Wilmington investigators were given reports that the tank barge was carrying liquid waste material, or possibly vegetable oils,  or possible tank washings consisting of various edible oil residues and caustic-based solvents.     On June 5, 1998, the owner of the Atlantic arranged for a marine chemist to evaluate the condition of the barge and to take samples of the liquid carried in the tanks.  Those samples were to be sent to a laboratory for analysis.  The marine chemist's atmospheric monitoring revealed that at least three of the cargo tanks were oxygen deficient (<15% oxygen).  During the sampling, MSO personnel observed liquid material that was very different from ballast water in several barge wing tanks (#1 port, #1 and #5 starboard) .  MSO Wilmington also sampled a number of the cargo tanks of the vessel including an 1800 gallon integral diesel fuel tank located in the aft rake of the barge.  Those samples were forwarded to the USCG Marine Safety Laboratory (Case Number 98-213) to classify the materials in the barge for regulatory purposes.  USCG district 5.  Keyword: none."

    "description": "At 2330 on Saturday, May 2, 1998 the D8 SSC was contacted by MSU Galveston concerning the report of a slick off the Texas Coast.  A ten mile long slick of \"thick light brown oil\" had been reported in position, lat: 27-40.0 N, long: 93-37.0 W or just south of the East Flower Garden Bank, National Marine Santuary.  The report was that four slicks of thick light brown oil extended for a distance of ten miles north of the above position.  The northern end of the slick was a \"diesel like\" sheen.  The SSC consulted with Jerry Galt and Glen Watabayashi of NOAA HAZMAT in Seattle and provided the Coast Guard with a verbal trajectory.  Seattle HAZMAT used the Texas General Land Office's (TGLO) TABS buoy system current information as well as current and forecasted weather information to evaluate the situation.  It was determined that the slick would most likely move to the WNW of the reported position at approximately 1/3 to 1/2 of a knot.  The reported position was as of 1730 on Saturday afternoon and due to logistical constraints the MSU was unable to schedule an overflight until Sunday afternoon.  In this interim the slick could be expected to move 10 miles to the WNW.  On Sunday afternoon the Coast Guard conducted an overflight and with the trajectory information provided, they were able to successfully locate the slick.  The overflight revealed a 200 x 200 yard slick of light brown oil which was somewhat patchy.  It is believed that either the initial report overestimated the amount of product or the majority had already evaporated.  Due to the distance offshore (100 miles) and the small amount of product no further response was warranted.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "While en route from Houston, Texas to New Orleans, Louisiana the barge CHESEAKEAK TRADER, Towed by the Tug CAPTAIN BILL suffered a structural failure of unknown origin and lost several containers overboard.  Approximately 26 containers from the first tier (hatch) and 4 containers from the second hatch were lost overboard and into the Gulf of Mexico, they have not yet been located.  The damaged tiers of containers do hold some hazardous materials and some may have been lost over the side.  The nature of the hazardous materials are mostly flammable liquids and acids.  No oxidizers, poisons, or explosive substances have been identified.  Overflights were conducted by a Falcon Jet out of ATC Mobile and by MSO personnel aborad a HH-65 from air station New Orleans.  An initial planning meeting was held at 1500 at the New Orleans MSO, in attendance were; USCG, NOAA, Louisiana State Police-Hazmat, NOFD-Hazmat, Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, salvage representatives, response contractors, cargo owner and the tug operator's representative.  At this initial meeting all known hazards were identified, all parties concerns were addressed and initial objectives were set.  Currently the tug and barge are en-route to the mouth of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO).  The MRGO is a channel which bypasses the Mississippi River and leads to the industrial canal of New Orleans.  The tug will be met by a USCG 41' patrol boat.  On board are members of the MSO and Gulf Strike Team.  They will conduct a visual inspection of the vessel and cargo stability and conduct basic air monitoring.  They will not be boarding the tug or barge.  Upon completion of this inspection a second planning meeting will be held later this evening (est. 1830).  At this time it is believed that the barge will be allowed to transit up the MRGO to the Sea-Land terminal in the industrial canal.  Once the barge is alongside more extensive air monitoring and initial space entries and assessments can be made.  Once a detailed assessment is made the containers can be safely removed.  NOAA has provided chemical characterization, CAMEO runs and interpretation, hazards assessment and weather support to this incident.  Attached are two photos of the barge and damaged containers taken by MSO New Orleans on 4/27.  They are saved in JPEG format.

    "description": "n the afternoon of 01April98 NOAA Hazmat was contacted by USCG MSU Galveston.  They relayed that three large sheens had been reported 65 miles off the Texas coast.  Seattle Hazmat, MASS personnel researched the coastal currents and weather forecast.  The slicks were determined to be no immediate threat to the coast, however, depending upon their exact nature (size, thickness and composition),  on-shore winds, and forecast for the next two days, it could increase the chances of impact.  As of 1100CST, 02April98, overflights have failed to detect any sign of the slicks.  The extremely light nature of the sheens and lack of any potential sources within several miles have lead responders to believe that the slicks may have been the result of oily bilge water discharge and most likely have they dissipated.  The NOAA HAZMAT's New Orleans SSC has been in contact with the MSU and is available should any sign of the sheens be located.

    "description": "On February 23, 1998, a security guard at the Caribbean Gulf Refinery facility reported oil in the water.  Initially the amount was thought to be 2000 barrels of diesel fuel.  The source, as determined by USCG personnel, was a below-ground pipeline.  Boom was placed across a nearby canal where oil was seeping, containing most of the oil.  The T/S Dion, unloading just before the incident, was also boomed. A USCG helicopter overflight on February 23 determined that all the product was contained in the booms.  Sorbent pads and two vacuum trucks were used in the canal to recover discharged oil.  Samples of the spilled oil spilled from the pipeline and the T/S Dion were collected.  Visual inspection indicated noticeable differences between the two.  Two trenches were dug to act as collection points significantly increasing the efficiency of the trucks.  USCG district 7.

A weather front was expected to move through the area within the next 24 hours.  The NOAA SSC was contacted at 1830 on January 23 and provided spill trajectory and expected fate/behavior of the oil. The following assumptions were made:  On January 23, the 200 ft fishing vessel ADRIATIC SEA sank approximately 90 nm north of American Samoa (12-46.9 S and 170-34.9 W).  After interviewing the crew, the fuel on board was reported to be approximately 220,000 gallons (vice 118,000) of diesel in four fishing holds and an unknown quantity in vessel fuel tanks.  Catastrophic release of the diesel from the four fishing holds occurred when the vessel sank.  On scene weather reported by C130 pilot overhead after the sinking was calm winds and seas with a 4 ft swell.  This weather has continued throughout January 24.

    "description": "DATE: December 24, 1997 1400 PDT - TO: NOAA SSC Ed Levine - FROM: NOAA/Hazardous Materials Response Team, Seattle, WA 98115 -  - SUBJECT: Barge Alaska -  - FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, PLEASE CONTACT JIM MORRIS, NOAA/HAZMAT SEATTLE, WA 98115. PHONE (206) 526-6317. - _ - Per your request we have looked at trajectory implications of the urea that has been released from the barge Alaska.  These notes are based on the following information:-  - A barge located at 56? 28'N, 132? 23'W (Wrangell, Alaska) is reported to have cracks in the starboard and portside.  The vessel is carrying an unknown amount of urea stored as a bulk product.  At this time, the vessel is not leaking product.-  - If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. - _ - 1) WEATHER - Today, the winds are forecast from the south at 30 knots with rain.  Tomorrow, the rain is expected to continue with winds from the south at 25 knots. -  - 2) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UREA - Urea is a white crystal or powder with very faint odor. It has a density of 1.3 (it would sink in water) and is soluble in water. Urea is commonly present in nature, in urine and other body fluid. As a fertilizer, urea contains 45-46% nitrogen, and is usually in the form of small pellets or granules. It is shipped in bags or in bulk.  -  - 3) TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS - The harbor is generally shallow and is rapidly flushed due to tidal action.  Any dissolved product will be quickly diluted by water exchange through the harbor entrance.  The dissolved urea will not affect the pH of the water much, the effect, if there is any, will be localized, and given the tidal current present any effect will quickly dissipated because of the flushing effect in the harbor. -  - 4)FATE AND EFFECT OF UREA - Solubility - Urea is very soluble in water.  In the case of a capsized vessel, the urea pellets will sink to the ocean floor while  dissolving in the water column. Water currents facilitate the dissolution process of urea in the same way that stirring a cup of coffee helps dissolve the sugar faster. Since the urea was stored in bulk, the granules may disperse as a \"cloud\" of fertilizer, each granule sinking independently while coming in full contact with the water. - Effect on pH - When urea dissolves in water it forms a weak base. The pH of the ocean water varies between 6.5 to 8.5. Usually it tends to be somewhat basic. In addition, the ocean has a substantial buffering capacity. In the past even large urea spills had minimal effect on the pH and we would expect the similar process during this incident. - Effect on the environment - We would not expect to see any algae bloom or other nutrient driven changes. The spilled urea dissolves quickly, eventually turning into carbon dioxide which escapes as gas and dissipates, and ammonia, which dilutes in the prevailing tidal current and quickly drops to ambient concentration. It is quite possible that the concentration of available nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) may be elevated for a short period of time at the immediate location of the spill. However, considering the rapid dilution and dispersion into the water column, exposure to organisms is predicted to be short-term. The biological literature focuses on phytoplankton effects and these seem to be mediated by light.  At this time of the year, the phytoplankton population is relatively small, and the amount of daylight minimal.  Adverse effects are expected to be minimal and confined to the harbor.

An MSO team was dispatched and found trace amounts of dime sized tarballs along the beach.  Personnel from the Point Reyes National Seashore and the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary began collecting oiled live birds and dead birds.  The Coast Guard conducted an overflight, but did not find any floating oil.  By Monday, there were over 50 birds found dead, and an estimated 200 birds observed oiled in an area extending out to the Farallone Islands and south to Ocean Beach.  Among the birds affected were 7 Snowy Plovers and one Brown Pelican, both endangered species.  The International Bird Rescue and Research Center in Berkeley CA began cleaning and rehabilitating oiled birds.  Assessment teams continued to find dime to half dollar sized tarballs along the shoreline and in the high tide debris line from Drakes Beach to Limantour Beach.  On Tuesday the SSC conducted an overflight and found no floating oil.  Clean up teams began removing oiled debris. In addition to oiled birds, there was a report of nine oiled (estimated 2% coverage) Elephant Seals observed near Chimney Rock. Shoreline assessment, wildlife collection, cleaning and rehabilitation continued.  On Wednesday, the assessment teams found no new oiling.  The cleanup crews finished cleaning the impacted areas.  Wildlife teams had collected a total of 78 oiled birds for cleaning, and found 194 birds dead.  Teams continued assessment of beaches and wildlife collection and observations.  Thursday continued with shore assessments, wildlife collections and observations.  There was no further shore impacts and sign off of some areas was started.  However late in the day, an additional 50 freshly oiled birds were reported and there were concerns about additional floating oil.  Today, the SSC conducted another overflight concentrating in an area between the Farallone Islands, Point Reyes and Bolinas Point.  Some areas of oil were found.  The areas consisted primarily of trace amounts of silver sheens and some scattered tarballs with sheen in convergence lines.  A larger area of sheen, tarballs, and tar patties was found south of the area about 20 east of San Pedro Point.  In the Drakes Bay area, teams continued to survey beach areas, and conduct wildlife collections and observations. Bird totals as of today are: 92 oiled birds collected for cleaning and rehabilitation and 278 birds found dead.  The SSC will conduct an overflight tomorrow and remains on call to assist as needed.

This meant that as the night temperatures decreased, the chemical could be a liquid and as the temperature increased during the day it could turn into a gas. The methods for detection identified were three different Drâ€°ger-Tubes that could measure methyl bromide at different concentration ranges and cross sensitivities. The SSC informed ACT NY that the two suits of protective clothing tested (PTFE Teflon and Saranex 23P) rated at less than 1-hour breakthrough time.  All suspicious containers onboard C/V Teval were tested and inspected by the responsible party's (RPs) chemical sampling team at the anchorage.

    "description": "On the morning of 11/2/97, the 144 foot fishing vessel NORTHERN VOYAGER, radioed the US Coast Guard that it was taking on water and sinking, 3.5 miles east Gloucester, MA.  The USCG responded with rescue units and retreived the crew.  In addition, the USCG placed damage control teams aboard in an attempt to control the flooding.  This action was in vain and the vessel sank in 150-250 feet of water.  She was carrying an estimated 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel, 200 gallons of lube oil and 400,000 pounds of herring.  At the time of the sinking the weather was harsh with heavy seas and winds over 15 knots. -  - Upon sinking, a USCG overflight observed a broken sheen extending northwesterly for approximately one mile at approximately 500 yards wide. -  - The NOAA SSC was notified of the spill directly by the MSO Boston.  After consulting with the weather service, SHIO and ADIOS, it was determined that land impacts of any significant amount were unlikely.  In addition, it was agreed that any attempt at protection strategies would prove pointless, given the heavy surf.  The FOSC considered sending divers to close the vents.  It was agreed that, if the vessel was in 200+ feet of water, such an operation would be unnecessarily risky to the divers. -  - On the morning (11/3/97) overflight, no sheen was sighted.  The vessel's owner had determined the depth of the vessel at 140 feet and had decided to send hard-hat divers to begin salvage operations.While the divers are on-station, they will close the vents to prevent any further release.  The diving operation will begin Tuesday (11/4/97), weather permitting.  USCG will monitor for oil releases at that time. -  - The vessel sank less than one mile north of the Stellwagon Bank National Marine Sanctuary and some twelve miles east of the Plum Island USFWS Reserve.

Reports were received from two rigs on the High Island lease block.  One report came from High Island 177 (position 29?11.0 N, 094?23.0 W) and the other from High Island 195 (position 29?10.34 N, 094?22.18 W).  The reported slick was estimated to be two miles wide by ten miles long consisting of a \"thick sheen\" or \"rainbow colored sheen and some dark areas\" depending upon the reporting party.  On-scene weather was winds from the SSW at 10-15 kts., seas of 4-6 feet, visibility of 5 miles and temperatures in the 70's. -  - MSU Galveston requested initial trajectory analysis and resources at risk from the Assistant SSC while simultaneously launching a helicopter overflight to confirm the sightings.-  - The initial assessment was that the slick was not an immediate threat to the coast and the present rough on-scene weather would facilitate dispersion of the slick, and that the passage of a front (expected in the following 12 hours) would cause the wind to shift around to the NNE, away from land further decreasing the threat.  The helicopter overflight revealed a two mile long slick of rapidly dissipating sheen.  Pending further developments the case was closed.  USCG district 8."

This pipeline connects the platform to the shoreline terminal at Point Arguello.  Platform Irene is operated by the Torch Operating Company for Nueva Energy (Houston).  The release was caused by a fracture in a weld near a flange at a depth of about 33 fathoms.  The amount released was originally reported as 2,900 barrels, which was the potential amount in the pipeline at the time the weld broke.  This amount was revised after overflights and other observations were conducted to between 200 and 500  barrels.  The oil was Monterey crude mixed with the drilling and pumping waters.  Skimming vessels from the Clean Seas Cooperative, MSRC and from the Fisherman's Oilspill Response Team were contracted for on-water collection.  The RP also alerted dispersant aircraft, but they were not used.  The RP assumed the major role in the response, with Federal agencies providing assistance and oversight.

    "description": "At approximately 2200, August 5, 1997, an unknown quantity of heavy fuel oil and jet fuel was spilled from the Tosco Refinery in Ferndale, Washington.  The spill occurred during operations in which a mixture of Jet A fuel and water was being pumped through a series of eight heavy fuel cargo lines to clean them.  The mixture is normally recirculated and reclaimed but, because of a misaligned valve, the mixture was released into a bermed sump area on the dock.  The oil mixture overflowed the berm and entered Puget Sound.  Boom was deployed around the spill site and geographical response plan protection strategies were implemented ahead of the expected path of the oil.  The highest priority for protection was determined to be Lummi Bay with its large areas of protected mud flats and eelgrass beds.   Overflights conducted on August 6 also reported the presence of killer whales and harbor seals feeding on migrating salmon near the oil slick.  These areas were closely monitored by Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife overflights with no impacts to whales or seals observed.   Open-water operations begun on August 6 consisted of skimming free- floating oil from the containment area next to the Tosco dock and enhanced skimming along convergence zones where primarily oiled seaweed and tarballs were collected.  By the end of the first day, only light sheen and tarballs in the kelp off the northeast and east shoreline of Vendovi Island were observed.  The following day, smaller quantities of oiled kelp were collected in convergence zones in Bellingham Bay and stranded oiled kelp was removed from Vendovi Island.  Active cleanup was completed on August 8.  USCG district 13.  Keyword: boom."

MSO Wilmington's impression was that the safety valve had released some of the material as the vessel arrived in warmer climates.

The vessel was scheduled into Wilmington, North Carolina on July 21.  The safety of the vessel's crew was  not an issue.

PVS 103 is still along the LDB near mile 225.  The pressure has equalized and no product and only light vapors are coming from the tank.  However, there is some quaintly ( how much is yet to be determined)  product in the bottom of the hopper.  It is reportedly approximately 3\" deep but the size of the puddle is not known.- -Air monitoring levels are 0 ppm at the riverbank and 15 ppm near the bottom of the hopper.  Evidently the hole was below the product level and some product was lost to the hopper.  Again, the quaintly is currently unknown. -The Unified Command is currently in a planning meeting.  The reported plan is:-1.  Clean up the bottom of the hopper.  Two options to be accomplished this are by either pumping or siphoning the product from the deck and flushing the deck with river water.  The specific course of action has not yet been finalized.-2.  Temporally patch the hole in the tank to avoid further loss of product during transit and.-3.  Move the Barge down river to mile 183.8 to off-load the product.- -NOAA SSC, LCDR Tim Steele is available and pageable to assist as needed.  USCG district 8."

The spill location coordinates are 40 deg. 35 min. 17 sec. N, 74 deg. 12 min. 33 sec. W.  The apparent cause of the spill was the deckhand fell asleep during the loading operation.  The barge was boomed prior to fuel transfer operations; most of the oil was contained within the boom.  Response contractor is on-scene.  Some oil has moved south to just north of the Outer Bridge Crossing.-  - Trajectory/Forecast: - The tide will change at 1100.  Forecasted winds should push the oil towards the Staten Island side of the kill.  Trajectory, ADIOS, and weather analysis predicts a 90% evaporation of the oil within 12 hours. -  - No NOAA personnel are anticipated to respond on-scene at this time.  USCG district 1."

Approximately 100 gallons of oil had discharged,  creating a sheen approximately 2,000 by 300 yards in George Inlet impacting approximately 1,200 feet of shoreline.  The Cape Fox Native Corporation was the RP and, using sorbents, attempted to remove as much oil as possible from the rocky cobble, mostly sheer rock,  and hard shale shoreline.  A log and a sorbent sausage boom were deployed around the oiled-beach area.  The oil had been in the tank for so many years that it was tarlike, was not spreading, and resembled a creosoted piling, even after using sorbents on it.  The oiled shoreline had very little bioactivity, only some seaweed and barnacles.    In the end, nothing was done, nothing was apparently affected,  and only a hard tar coating on the bottoms of some of the rocks could be found to show that anything had happened.  USCG district 17.

Logistical constraints, the fact that product was trapped in the ballast tanks, foul weather, and the unavailability of a lightering vessel forced the Formosa Six to remain offshore until May 14.

    "description": "On January 25, 1997, the tug Sea Valor, attempting to change the tow cable on the Crowley barge Oregon, punctured the #5 starboard tank of the barge.  The tank flooded, causing the barge to roll upside down, releasing most of her 12,500 tons of bulk granular urea six miles west of Ninilchik, Alaska in Lower Cook Inlet at a water depth of approximately 120 feet.  The COTP ordered the barge towed upside down into Kachema Bay for salvage.  Once there,  high winds forced the vessel to circle around before finally being anchored and boomed off just off the end of Homer spit.  Of equal concern were fuel tanks with 1,000 gallons of diesel and roughly 250 gallons of other general oils.   No sheen was noticed and these tanks appeared intact.   Diver inspection of the overturned hull reported that all doors and hatches were closed and sealed, except for a port aft cargo door that was buckled in about two feet leaving a one-foot opening to the cargo hold.   Initially, divers were unable to determine how much cargo remained onboard.   Subsequent diving provided evidence that probably all the urea had been washed out.   The upside-down barge was rigged with towing and other safety gear and towed in that configuration to Seattle for further salvage.    The barge was owned by Crowley; UNOCAL owned the urea.  Both become very involved in the response.  Crowley brought a second tug to Kachemak Bay for standby; provided sea-curtain boom; and mobilized Chadux, the non-persistent fuels spill coop, to deal with any possible petroleum release.   Meanwhile, UNOCAL had an environmental scientist from California on-scene to answer questions about the massive urea release, and to conduct a water-sampling program to assure officials and citizens the urea levels were low around the anchored barge in Kachemak Bay and at the initial release site.

Of primary concern were the sheltered salt marshes of the Great Salt Pond on the northwest side of the island and the lobster population in the immediate area.  The winds were from the southwest, blowing oil out to sea and away from sensitive areas.  Over the next 48 hours, small craft advisories and gale warnings with 6- to 12-foot seas were forecast from the southwest, endangering the vessel's  position.  Attempts to bring an offloading vessel alongside were hampered by the heavy weather and shallow water. On December 23, 1996, overflight observers saw rainbow sheens from the vessel extending northeasterly for approximately one mile.  It was believed that the starboard tank was holed and leaking. The heaviest weather passed through on December 24, 1996.  The following day the vessel was intact, but it was believed that more fuel had been released and the starboard tank was holed.  The FOSC suspended operations over the holiday. On December 26 a USCG dedicated pollution overflight observed very little sheening.  The USCG and salvors began offloading operations.  By December 27 it was estimated that more than 3,100 gallons of fuel had been removed and approximately 4,000 gallons had been lost.

The burning vessel was intentionally grounded for the safety of the crew and vessel, and to help control the vessel during the incident.  On November 15 three of the loaded barges were removed; the remaining nine barges helped keep the tug solidly grounded.    The inside of the superstructure of the towboat was almost completely burned.  There were concerns that the fire could cause the vessel's fuel tanks to breakup, catch fire, and possibly release a significant amount of oil.  Boom was placed around the vessel to help prevent oil from being transported downriver.  Drinking water managers downriver were notified.  A small oil sheen was observed in the river.

Some of the material was recovered but, once in the water, it congealed into white, jelly-like globs, some as large as golf balls.  This substance has a density similar to water so the globs dispersed through various depths down to about eight feet.    Because the chemical did not stay at the surface, using a water-skimming boom to recover the chemical was not feasible.  The substance was still visible the next day in Ward Cove, but seemed to dissipate by that evening.  Optimer 7128 is a non-regulated substance, is not listed by the Federal Government as a marine pollutant, and does not pose a hazard to navigation.   KPC employees maintained a visual watch over the area and sampled water quality at sites specified by State and Federal agencies.  In addition, a monitoring plan is being developed  to better understand the full effects of this substance on the environment.

The pilot prepared for passage through the \"Million Dollar Bridge,\" an extremely narrow draw bridge, affording less than five feet of clearance on either side of the vessel's mid-section.  Accounting for a rising tide and southwesterly winds, the pilot approached the opening from the northern portion of the Fore River and misspoke the helm command.  By the time the order could be corrected, less than a minute later, the vessel was committed and allision (a moving object hitting a stationary one) imminent.  The Julie N struck the southern side of the bridge,  a sharp buttress damaged her just below the waterline  The exposed part of the bridge opened a 15-foot hole into the forward port bunker tank, the forward void space, and the number one port cargo tank.  The gash in the cargo tank was small by comparison to that of the bunker tank,  less than a foot wide and approximately three feet  high.  The bunker tanks were carrying intermediate fuel oil (IFO) 380.  The vessel reported the allision immediately to the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and asked permission to proceed to the Sprague Terminal, some 1,000 yards downriver.  Permission was granted.  The Julie N headed for the terminal, leaking oil as she went.  The local oil spill cooperative, Clean Casco Bay, Inc., was notified as were state and federal authorities.  As the ship was tying up to the Sprague pier, state and spill cooperative personnel were deploying a variety of booms around the injured vessel.  During that time, USCG personnel on-scene, estimated that the vessel was leaking at a rate of 500 to 700 gallons per minute.  Over the course of the next 12 hours, the Julie N would lose a total of 180,000 gallons of oil, 88,200 gallons of HHF and 93,450 gallons of IFO 380.   At times during the night, oil was estimated to be seven inches deep inside the boom.  USCG district 1.

Heavy contamination is approximately 25 by 75 feet in marsh grass, and run off continued down a narrow drainage channel to Gastineau Channel.  The free product was cleaned up with sorbent pads, and the oiled vegetation and contaminated soil were removed from the site.   The leaking tank was emptied and removed.  The contractor hired by the potentially responsible party (PRP) recommended that any further ground disturbance or excavation would cause more harm than good and that in-situ biologically enhanced treatment should be undertaken.  This treatment involved adding a garden-variety slow-release, high-nitrogen fertilizer to stimulate bacterial degradation of soil hydrocarbons and promote vascular plant regeneration, and by placing 6- to 12-inch diameter transplants from adjacent wetlands on four foot centers in the excavated area.

The tug Scandia was located some three miles south and west of Point Judith, Rhode Island towing the barge North Cape, which was carrying 94,000 barrels of #2 home heating fuel  Weather was severe with sustained winds of more than 40 knots from the south-southeast and forecast to increase.  The tug Scandia was abandoned and USCG Search and Rescue teams were dispatched to assist the crew.  At approximately 2000 EST, a USCG helicopter reported that the barge North Cape was aground on Nebraska Shoals, directly adjacent to the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge, owned and operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  The helicopter further reported that the barge was releasing oil.  The barge North Cape spilled oil in two separate releases.  The first, released during the height of the initial storm, was 700,000 gallons and the second, less than a day later, was 125,000 gallons.  The combination of the type of oil released and the energy of the storm caused great dispersion into the water column.  As a result, in the days following the spill, great numbers of shellfish (mostly bivalves and juvenile lobsters) washed  ashore.  Subsequently, the Rhode Island Department of Health closed more than 200 square miles of commercial fishery in the area of the spill.  This closure was coordinated with the EPA Region One and with NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which closed federal fishing grounds using the Magnuson Act.  This is the first time federal fisheries have been closed due to oil contamination.  The emergency phase of the response lasted seven days and the on-scene command post was demobilized following the removal of the barge North Cape from the beach.  Active USCG spill response and assessment continued from the MSO, including re-survey of key impacted recreational and endangered piping plover nesting beaches.  The full re-opening of the Rhode Island fishery was not complete until the middle of June.  Organoleptic panels were established to certify that seafood, lobsters, and clams, in particular, were marketable.  USCG district 1.  Keyword: endangered species, ARTES."

The products of concern were n-butyl isocyanate (thirty-six 55-gallon drums) and carbonyl iron powders (100 drums [9,500 kilograms]).  The container carrying the n-butyl isocyanate was damaged, but there was no evidence that any drums inside were breached.  The carbonyl iron powder containers showed no signs that the contents had spilled.  Based on information from NOAA's science team and more specific information from the shipper of the n-butyl isocyanate (Bayer Corp.), the USCG, Boston Fire Department, Massachusetts Port Authority, the shipping agent, and the NOAA SSC began developing contingency plans for surveying and offloading the vessel.  The vessel was due to arrive at Boston Harbor at 2300 January 16, 1996.  She was ordered to remain at the outer anchorage until a contracted survey team and the USCG could board her and assess the risks of bringing her into the inner harbor.  The vessel was not allowed to offload the damaged containers until the next day.  Because of the delays expected in Boston overnight, the MSC Claudia determined it was in her best interest to steam to her next port of call, New York.

Extensive damage was sustained by the empty bulk-solid barge and one of the tank barges, Apex 3512.  Apex 3512 discharged approximately 4,600 barrels of slurry oil from the forward tank.  At the time of the collision the weather was clear and the current in the channel was approximately two knots.  During preliminary surveys on October 11 and 12, large pockets of oil were found where the barge was pushed against the bank.  The currents in this area are slight and the bottom topography levels out after a 45-degree, 35-foot slope from the bank.  Sheening was seen over the area.

If it was discovered that the material onboard was not an oily material that could be categorized as a \"waste oil,\"  but rather contained high levels of chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the safety of site workers and the funding mechanism for the cleanup operation would have to be reconsidered.    NOAA participated with MSO Hampton Roads in several meetings before removal was started and by telephone during the removal operations.  The goals of the sampling program and the details of sample results were discussed during these meetings.  For example, sample analysis on the T/B Bunker Delaware indicated waste oil in all tanks with waste oil and some traces of benzene in #3 and #4 port tanks only.  The level of benzene concentration in these tanks was specifically documented as part of the safety program, but the other appropriate reason for the testing was to determine levels of benzene that were needed to categorize the waste for disposal and/or resale purposes.

In Auke Bay, the vessel dropped anchor and was surrounded with boom to catch additional releases.  None occurred.  A sheen extended south of Poundstone Rock for a few miles amid conflicting reports of whether it contained any recoverable oil.

It is possible that the release was gradual over the course of weeks or months until the material released reached a level that caused a visible reaction in the waters of the barge canal.  The spill site is actually two water bodies; an industrial barge canal in Bienville Industrial Park and a freshwater riverine/marsh habitat in the adjacent Mulatto Bayou.  Mulatto Bayou runs somewhat parallel to the barge canal with several bank cuts allowing water interchange between the two.  Hopper barges RL-224 and RL-229 had been alongside the industrial park at the dead end of the barge canal for several weeks and several months, respectively.  Their cargo of dry ferrous sulfate was destined for Eaglebrook Inc. but was rejected because it was out of specification for their needs.  Ferrous sulfate is reacted in a controlled situation by Eaglebrook to make a flocculating agent used in wastewater treatment.  As the barges waited at the industrial park pending final disposition, it is believed that water entered the barges through holes in their wing tanks and then, through free communication with the hoppers themselves, made contact with the cargo.  During the response the contaminated water in the hoppers was found to have a pH of approximately 2.0.  The contaminated water in the wing tanks was found to have a pH of approximately 3.0.  This water, carrying unreacted product, is thought to have escaped the barge and entered the barge canal.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: none."

The next day winds and currents carried the hull north into American waters where approximately two feet of the inverted hull could still be seen.  A USCG helicopter searched the area noting three red 55-gallon drums, paint cans, life buoys, and wood floating near the site of the capsizing.  A helicopter search on January 17 revealed no vessel, debris, or pollution.  Weather throughout the incident was southeast winds 15 to 25 knots, seas reasonably calm, and broken cloud cover.  Response and search were terminated on January 17. It is not known whether any diesel was actually released; however, the vessel sank with 24,000 gallons of diesel onboard in approximately 1,000 feet of water.  USCG district 17.

Crowley deployed boom around the barge and started recovery operations within the boom using portable disk skimmers.  Divers surveyed the vessel and discovered a 4-foot by 4-inch gash in the #6 starboard tank 18 feet below the water line, and a 6-inch long crack in the #4 starboard tank; no oil was seen leaking from either damaged tank.  The #5 starboard tank showed signs of damage but had not been holed.  Divers patched the holes in both damaged tanks and operations to lighter the entire 63,000 barrels of cargo before moving the damaged barge were begun.  Lightering took place in three separate off-loading operations using a second tug and tank barge that subsequently off-loaded to the T/V Ocean Spirit anchored nearby.  Lightering was completed at 1300 on January 1, 1995, and Barge 101 was towed by tug Mercury to Terminal 115 in the Duwamish Waterway, Seattle, Washington, to await inspection in a dry dock.

    "description": "The USCG MSO Puget Sound received a report of a fire on the  F/V Yardarm Knot at 0830 on November 8, 1994.  The vessel was moored at the Coastal Transport dock on the ship canal in Ballard, a suburb of Seattle, Washington.  At the time of the fire, 70,000 gallons of #2 fuel oil in the double-bottom fuel tanks, one 3,000 pound tank of anhydrous ammonia, various cans of paint products, and eight 150-pound cylinders of chlorine were onboard.  An unknown amount of chlorine was released during the fire and 15 firefighters suffered respiratory distress and minor skin irritation.  The USCG MSO dispatched a USCG Fire Fighting Coordinator, HAZMAT team, and a 41-foot patrol boat to assist the Seattle Fire Department Incident Commander. The fire started in the forward part of the processing area of the vessel when a welding spark fell on combustible material.  The fire spread to the lower deck and forward to the forecastle, causing extensive damage to the factory processing area.  Smoke from the fire necessitated closing the Ballard Bridge to traffic.  The main fire was extinguished at 1130, but the vessel contained hot spots and continued to have small flare ups through the night and into the next day.  Chlorine levels continued to be detected on the vessel and on the dock alongside, but, due to the threat of re-flash, the Seattle Fire Department suspended efforts to mitigate the potential chlorine release until November 10.  A USCG HAZMAT team member remained on-scene with the Seattle Fire Department overnight fire watch.  A unified command was set up among the USCG, State of Washington, vessel owner, and the Seattle Fire Department to address the continuing threat of a chlorine and/or ammonia release from the vessel.  The unified command met several times November 9 and 10 to review plans for site safety, the proposed repair and removal of the chlorine cylinders, ventilation of lower compartments, and vessel salvage.   The chlorine threat was mitigated, the fire completely extinguished, and the vessel declared safe for entry by the morning of November 10.  The vessel was towed to Northlake Shipyard for repairs.

    "description": "Between October 18 and 20, a strong low-pressure system stalled over the Houston area producing more than 30 inches of rain.   The San Jacinto River rose from its normal height of 2.5 feet to 24.3 feet.  The river overtopped its banks, cutoff a meandering loop, and scoured a new channel through a normally dry area containing pipelines.  As a result of the flooding, Houston had been declared a National Disaster Area and the estuarine environments of Galveston Bay were stressed because of the influx of fresh floodwaters.   As the flood waters began to recede, pipelines began to rupture. It was surmised that large debris or some barges had broken free and were caught in the high-river currents and collided with the pipelines, causing four of them to rupture.  It is also possible that the new channel cut by the flooded river may have undercut the pipeline supports, which were not designed for water crossing.     The ruptured pipelines contained gasoline, crude oil, heating oil, and natural gas.  Within hours of the ruptures, the spilled products ignited and, already caught up in the flood waters, become a burning mass moving downstream.  The fires destroyed many homes along the river banks.  However, as a result of the fire much of the spilled products were consumed.  After some time, the fire continued only at the source of the leaks.  The natural gas leak stopped, but a combination of the remaining products continued to leak.  USCG district 8.

Immediately suspect was a 12-inch diameter pipeline (constructed in 1961) owned by Buckeye Corporation extending from New Haven, Connecticut to Westover Air Force Base carrying a number of petroleum products ranging from gasoline to #2 fuel oil.  The pipeline runs along the base of the Conrail train bed (north side) in the area of the Little River; the leak appeared to have originated on the east side of the river.  Buckeye assumed responsibility for the spill.  While a pipeline failure of some kind was suspected, extensive excavation did not uncover the exact location and 1,800 feet of pipeline were abandoned in place to be filled with concrete in summer 1995.  After extensive pressure-testing of the replaced section, the pipeline was reactivated on October 31, 1994.  USCG district 1.  Keyword: sorbent boom, containment boom, evaporation, vacuum trucks."

A USCG boat out of Station Neah Bay confirmed the sighting before dark, describing it as a silver sheen containing intermittent brown patches, 1.5 feet wide by 6 feet long, made up of small tarballs described as brown, gooey clumps.  They estimated the slick covered a two- by six-mile area. On September 24, response equipment was pre-staged at Port Angeles and pre-planned protection booming as specified in the Geographical Response Plan was deployed at the Waatch and Sooes rivers to protect local salmon runs.  Searches for the oil at first light by Canadian and USCG vessels, spill response contractor vessels, and helicopters were significantly hampered by heavy fog that continued throughout the day. The Vessel Traffic Service coordinated with all commercial vessels transiting the area for reports of any oil sighting.   After not being able to find the slick, searches were discontinued at night fall, to be resumed at first light September 25.  Response equipment was left in place at Port Angeles and Neah Bay.  Heavy fog prevailed throughout the next 24 hours.  When the fog finally lifted, two bands of emulsified oil were sighted by an overflight late in the afternoon of September 26 near Point of Arches, eight miles south of Neah Bay.  However, the following morning, overflights and shoreline surveys were unable to locate any oil.  Search for the oil was suspended at 1600 on September 27 and all equipment stood down.

    "description": "On the morning of September 1, 1994,  the barge Annahootz spilled approximately 500 gallons of diesel into Cook Inlet while onloading at the Port of Anchorage.  The spill  occurred when oil flowed up through the No. 1 port expansion trunk and sounding tube saturating the  barge's wooden deck.  The response was initiated by Forty-Niner Transportation, the responsible party; but Verca, a local spill contractor,  was hired to complete the response.  The oil moved under the dock and out the north end in response to a back eddy from the ebbing tide.  Containment boom and sorbents were deployed around the barge and at the north end of the dock.  Sheen extended north along the shore 50 to 100 yards offshore from near the dock to the vicinity of Cairn Point.  Overflight observers reported isolated ribbons and stringers of sheen with no more than 50 gallons of diesel on the water near Cairn Point and no wildlife activity on shore within four miles.  Much of the diesel dispersed naturally in the energetic currents of Cook Inlet.  However, the next morning MSO representatives noted approximately five small sheens in the dock area and judged that further cleanup was possible.  Approximately 100 to 110 gallons of oil-water mix were recovered.  The weather throughout the incident was light winds from the southwest and good visibility.  USCG district 17.

The grounding occurred very early August 10 and fuel tanks were immediately breached.  The barge had 20,000 gallons of diesel onboard.  The weather continued to deteriorate as winds increased to 30 to 40 knots, with high  seas and heavy breakers pounding the barge and Cape Nome.  The owner believes that most of the 20,000 gallons was lost during the first 12 hours.  The responsible party was very cooperative with the USCG and was very proactive in attempts to salvage the barge.  The continuation of high winds, however, caused further deterioration and damage to the barge, so it was towed offshore and scuttled.  The owner saved a large crane onboard and used temporary patches to ensure the barge's flotation en route to the scuttle area.  Heavy weather persisted as the barge was towed offshore.   Finally, in 135 feet of water, explosive charges were detonated and the barge was sunk at 64?28.37', 169?25.14'.  This response lasted 16 days.  USCG district 17.  Keyword: none."

    "description": "On Sunday morning, July 24, 1994, a fire broke out in the fore section hold of the fish processor All Alaskan, a 350-foot vessel processing salmon.  The vessel was approximately 10 miles west of Cape Sarichef on the western side of Unimak Island and riding in relatively calm seas.  At the time of the fire, the vessel was carrying 126,000 gallons of diesel fuel, 7 bottles of acetylene, 12 bottles of oxygen, 10,000 gallons of lube oil, 8 drums of hydraulic oil, 2 drums of gasoline, and 38,000 pounds of ammonia.  After the initial diesel release on July 24, additional oil pollution was considered a low probability as the integrity of the fuel tanks and hull were not threatened by the fire. The USCG responded to what was initially a search and rescue mission.  They safely rescued all but one crewmember who, unfortunately, was killed while fighting the fire.  The fire caused the failure of a 10,000-gallon diesel day tank on the fore deck and the explosion, release, and fire of most of the 38,000 pounds of ammonia.  The diesel release resulted in a reported 8-mile long sheen that dissipated within 12 hours. To move the vessel from the sensitive resources in Unimak Pass, a bridle was fitted to the stern of the All Alaskan and she was slowly towed westward to deeper water in case scuttling became necessary.  The fire subsided by Monday, July 25 but continued smoldering in the fore peak holds of the vessel.  Three USCG cutters and several members of the Pacific Strike Team went to the scene to assist. On July 26 the vessel was brought into Captain's Bay at Dutch Harbor where the fire was completely extinguished and the vessel was thoroughly evaluated.  One bottle of ammonia was found slowly leaking after the vessel reached port; the rest were believed lost while the vessel was burning at sea.  As the vessel cooled down and aired out, the response phase was replaced with a vessel integrity evaluation phase done primarily by the U. S.

Weather was light haze, visibility about five miles, temperature 95?F, winds 12 knots from the south, and calm seas. The vessel arrived at the dock with some bottom damage,;apparently she hit a submerged object.  An estimate of 40 to 50 gallons of oil was initially thought lost.  The vessel was boomed and lightering of suspected tanks (#3 port cargo tank [PCT] and #4 port ballast tank [PBT]) began.  A diver's inspection reported a 2- by 10-foot breech of the hull in #3 PCT above the bilge knuckle, and 30 feet of the bilge keel missing.  At 2135 on July 19 it was reported that oil had breached the containment boom and 200 to 300 barrels were in the water.  It was believed that while offloading the cargo in the damaged tank, the water-bottom was upset allowing the oil to escape. Mobil response team personnel boomed the vessel.  The Delaware Bay and River Cooperative (DBRC) launched two skimmers and boomed several pre-identified creeks nearby.  Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) responded with its skimming vessel (Delaware Responder).  Three additional contractors were hired for the cleanup and a field command post was established at the Mobil refinery. The USCG COTP Philadelphia assumed the FOSC role for this incident. USCG personnel were onscene to monitor cleanup activities.  The OSC requested two forward-looking infrared radar (FLIR) overflights (one during the night of July 19; the other the next morning) to help identify the extent of oil migration in the river.

The barge was in tow from Toledo, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio carrying 1,013,325 gallons of No. 6 Fuel Oil.  In 1961, the Army Corps of Engineers supervised a salvage operation to raise the barge from its original location, move it clear of the shipping lanes, and resink it in 70 feet of water.  Records showed that the barge, currently resting keel up,  could still contain up to 800,000 gallons of product in 5 of its 6 tanks.  The COTP federalized the incident after divers observed an ounce of oil leaking out of a 1.5 inch valve every 13 minutes.  This leak was plugged on 16 July and an inspection of all exposed valves on the hull was conducted.  These valves were installed in the hull during the initial salvage in 1961 to pump air into the tanks in order to raise the barge.  USCG district 2.  Keyword: NAVSUPSALV."

During initial attempts to control the well, uncontrolled downhole pressure release was experienced (a kick). The slip was boomed and it was estimated 10 barrels of distillate were in the slip, none in the Intracoastal Waterway. The evening of July 8 a new plan was submitted to control the well which included moving in a fire prevention barge.  July 9 preparations for the well capping were proceeding.  Three firefighting barges were being moved into place.  Well control experts approached the well and sprayed a fog of foam and water for 10 minutes to reduce the treat of explosion prior to a plugging attempt.  Workers were on the rig for approximately 3 minutes when at1311 the well ignited and exploded.  The source of ignition has not yet been determined.  The explosion led to the deaths of two people and the hospitalization of four others.  The well is currently spewing clear to orange flames 100 feet in the air. There has been a continual rain in the area.  An estimated 100 barrels of a light sweet crude had been in the water.  A 10 knot south wind has aided in the recovery operations of the crude. No pollution has been seen outside the slip.  Preparations for capping the well and recovery of all distillates are proceeding.

Of initial concern was the presence of Tropical Storm Alberto in the Gulf of Mexico forecasting a potential of 50-knot east winds on site.  July 2, the storm had moved from the original forecast and 25-knot north winds were being forecasted.    The fire on the Forum Chemist  was extinguished the evening of July 3,1994.

Investigation led to the discovery of a transfer pipeline failure and EDC on the ground and under a layer of water in an adjacent ditch.  The ditch outflow to the Calcasieu River was blocked and recovery operations began.  By May 31, approximately 630,000 pounds (1,500 barrels) of EDC had been recovered from the ditch.  Conoco's contractor collected a sediment sample from the Calcasieu River.  Analysis of this sample revealed a concentration of 11,800 parts per million of EDC prompting a new sampling plan for the river.  On June 7, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assumed the role of Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), a representative from the State was designated on-scene coordinator (OSC), and NOAA and the Gulf Strike Team (GST) were released from the scene.  When NOAA left the scene, a river sampling program was underway using core sampling in deep areas and grab samples in shallower areas to collect sediments on the river bottom and determine the extent of contamination.

    "description": "An oil production field leased and operated by the UNOCAL Corporation near Guadalupe, California, has for many years been the site of a constant release of a diesel-like substance known as diluent.  The diluent, which is a mid-grade condensate product, had been injected into the production wells throughout recent decades to increase the yield from the oilfield.  For economic reasons, the practice of injecting diluent into the wells replaced the use of steam during the 1950s.  UNOCAL stopped injecting diluent by 1990.  Either through poor injection practices or through a faulty pipeline system, diluent was released into the field in large quantities.  Current estimates are that there may be as much as 8.5 million gallons of diluent located in various plumes throughout the 2,300 acre site.  The diluent plumes are below ground, riding on top of the water table.  USCG district 11.

The 202-foot Cynthia M, with a capacity of 340,000 gallons, was loaded with 310,000 gallons of a 30 percent solution of caustic soda.  Her list was suspected to have been caused by open valves that allowed free communication of liquids between internal tanks.  The weather onscene was winds from the southwest at 15 to 20 knots.  The tidal excursions for the Hackensack River were estimated to be between three-quarters of a mile and one mile. The port side of the barge was completely submerged from center line to rail, resting solidly on the bottom.  The USCG, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and Energy, and New Jersey Marine Police went to the scene and assessed the situation.  Initially, the capsizing of the vessel and its subsequent loss of cargo were the greatest concerns.  On March 16 it was estimated that approximately 150,000 gallons of cargo had been lost into the Hackensack River and Newark Bay.  The caustic soda escaped from a vent on deck that had submerged because of the vessel's list.  At 1235 water testing of pH near the barge showed readings of 12; by 1535 the readings were 9, indicating that pH was returning to normal levels. The responsible party hired a marine salver to raise the barge, and state and federal agencies monitored the water pH until it returned to normal.

    "description": "On February 9, 1994, there was a pipeline leak at the Mistryski Power Plant along the Detroit River in Detroit, Michigan.  The power plant is approximately two miles downriver of the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit.  The leak was continuous and occurred from approximately 2230 on February 9 to 0330 on February 10 and was described as flowing at the rate of a fire-hose discharge.  Oil had broken through a corroded portion of a 10-inch supply line, ran into a storm sewer, and then traveled about 100 feet to enter the river.  When the incident occurred, the Detroit River was 95 percent ice-covered. Originally the released product was thought to be a #6 oil, but laboratory analysis proved it was a #4 fuel with density of 0.93.  The original estimate of 10,000 to 30,000 gallons proved a conundrum as only about 300 gallons was observed in the river.  Later volume refinements had the number at officially  less than 900 gallons and most likely around 300 gallons.  The City of Detroit assumed responsibility for the spill and immediately hired Marine Pollution Control.  Only a limited response was possible due to the ice.  A portion of the spilled oiled was recovered by removing the oil-stained ice accessible from the shorelines.  The Detroit City Laboratory performed the first analysis on the oil, determining that it was a #4 rather than a #6, and that it was a \"floater\".  The City immediately hired Tri-State Bird Rescue to assess the threat to nearly 5000 birds in the oiled area and to establish a rehabilitation center, if necessary. The Joint U.S./Canada contingency plan was invoked and a unified command was formed among the USCG, the City of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the Canadian Coast Guard.  All activities took place at the MSO Detroit office. The active response lasted for only four days.  On the fifth and sixth days, the temperature rose into the 40s and the wind shifted to from the east allowing more of the oil-stained ice to migrate to the shoreline where it could be removed.  The increased temperatures caused an ice jam that flushed all the remaining oiled ice down the Trenton Channel into still frozen Lake Erie.   Only two oiled birds died as a result of the spill.

    "description": "On January 7, 1994, the barge Morris J. Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.  The barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel.   The responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.  The USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea.   On January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.  Shoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.  On February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent.   All necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the \"how clean is clean\" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: endangered species, bioremediation."

    "description": "On the morning of December 25, 1993, a failure of a pipeline belonging to Berry Petroleum was reported.   The failure occurred below the ground near a pipe junction on the east side of Harbor Boulevard just south of Ventura, California.  Approximately 2,000 barrels of a heavy crude produced from a local field, percolated through the ground to the west and underneath the road.  The oil surfaced 50 yards west of Harbor Boulevard and entered a creek,  traveled along this creek approximately 150 yards to the south where it entered McGrath Lake. McGrath is a freshwater lake (approximately 800 by 100 yards) situated amongst medium-coarse grained sand dunes and is located 100 to 200 yards inshore of the intertidal zone.  The lake serves as a drainage basin for the surrounding agricultural fields and has no natural communication with the ocean.  To control the lake level, water is routinely pumped out of the lake and into the Pacific Ocean through a pipeline running through the dunes and onto the beach.  When the oil entered the lake, the pump was on and oil was discharged onto the sand beach and into the nearshore environment.  Less than 100 barrels of oil entered the ocean; the majority was contained in the lake, the creek, or was saturated in the sediment. The mouth of the Santa Clara river was bermed to prevent oil from entering the estuary.  To control the amount of water flowing through the spill site, water was diverted from the creek to the Santa Clara River via pumps.  Underflow dams and filter fences with sorbent pompoms were installed along the creek.  The vegetated shoreline of the creek and the lake, consisting mostly of tules, was heavily coated with oil.  Because all pumping operations had ceased, the water level in the lake was rising and began covering over already impacted shoreline and affecting more habitat as it rose.  After consulting with the Regional Water Quality Control Board, pumping the lake into the ocean began again and the water level was lowered to where it had been before the spill.  USCG district 11.

    "description": "The USCG received a report of oil emanating from an unknown source at an outfall in Echo Bay, New Rochelle, New York at 1500 on December 6, 1993.  Macy's Department Store, located in a mall less than one mile from the outfall, was identified as the source and responsible party by USCG investigators.  Approximately 7,000 gallons of #4 oil had flooded the basement of the store and entered a storm sewer that flowed into Echo Bay.  Macy's was reluctant to assume responsible party status for the incident, but eventually consented to do so. The USCG hired a cleanup contractor who boomed the outlet and downstream area.  Oil was contained close to the source, but some oil entered a nearby marina. Weather at the time of the incident was moderate ,with an air temperature of 40?F, water temperature of 49?F, winds out of the northwest at 15 to 20 knots, and calm seas.  USCG district 1.

The initial reports from vessels and responders were that the amount of the loss of #6 black oil from #1 starboard tank or the extent of oil trailing the vessel could not be determined.  Heavy fog prevented an overflight of the potentially impacted areas from daybreak on September 18 until late afternoon.  The C&D Canal remained closed from the time of the incident report until Saturday afternoon when the first overflights reported visible light sheen, but no visible oil in the canal or its immediate approaches.  USCG response vessel's personnel reported only small oil streamers from off Turkey Point to the Elk River. Soundings of the T/B New Jersey by the AST on the same afternoon suggested that the maximum loss would be 4,915 gallons, but a lesser amount was anticipated because no new oil sightings had been reported.  A first light overflight on September 19 noted that the light sheen seen the previous day was no longer visible.  Some sheen was reported in a small boat basin on the west end of the canal and oil was seen on the shoreline near Port Herman.

After the hurricane moved north past the North Carolina outer banks, MSO Hampton Roads launched an observation flight to assess the damage done to the island's infrastructure, homes, and environment.  The overflight found three areas in need of immediate attention.   Oden Dock Marina (loss of a 500-gallon waste oil tank), Pelican's Roost Texaco Station (loss of a 2,000- to 3,000-gallon #2 diesel tank) and a location near the Pilot House Restaurant  (loss of a home heating oil tank estimated less than 100 gallons).  After the initial on-site inspections, MSO Hampton Roads maintained a staff at the island's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) with other federal, state and local emergency response personnel for two weeks. The USCG surveyed the entire coast of Hatteras Island by helicopter and land-based Pollution Response teams (PRTs).  There was very little oil spilled; eight spills were reported and only three of these required cleanup.  By September 3 cleanup at Oden's Marina and the restaurant had been completed and the removal of oil from the damaged Texaco tanks was underway.  About 2,500 gallons of oil were collected and removed. The emergency response activities from Hurricane Emily on Hatteras Island consumed the attention and resources of most of the emergency response staff and the island's residents.

The weather was clear and calm at the time of the incident.  The vessel incurred major damage to the bow section.  Approximately 100 gallons of diesel was released into the water from a 7,200 gallon bow fuel tank before the large influx of water created a water bottom.  The vessel was rapidly taking on water and in danger of sinking, but the USCG provided air-deployable pumps that curbed the onrush of water.  The Yorktown Clipper limped into Shag Cove, a small arm in Glacier Bay, under its own power where the it was boomed while divers, salvers, and marine architects worked to evaluate, stabilize, and patch the holes with wood plugs, epoxy, and concrete. Because the vessel was within the bounds of Glacier Bay National Park, park service personnel were concerned about an additional release of diesel as it exited Glacier Bay.  With NOAA assisting, they evaluated resources, made contingency plans, and issued the following conditions under which the vessel could leave the Bay: 1)  The vessel will get underway shortly before high tide and transit the bay at ebb tide at no more than  five knots down the main channel 2)  An LCM with pollution response equipment will escort the ship 3)  Speed outside Glacier Bay will be determined by the vessel's master 4)  The vessel will make periodic security broadcasts while inside Glacier Bay The vessel safely exited the Bay on August 24.

The Coast Guard established a 1500 yard evacuation zone around the vessel.  The source of the vapor cloud could be from one or both of two intermodal tanks of 5000 gallons each.  The first contains acetaldehyde oxime (CAS 107-29-9) and the second chloroacetic acid (CAS 79-11-8).  The two intermodal tanks are stacked one on the other, but it is not known which is on top.  Either chemical could have caused the vapor cloud.  At 1025 EST, Charleston Fire Department personnel in level A protection, viewed the deck of the ship from a nearby crane.  No vapor cloud was observed and it appeared that the two tanks were not leaking. Current on-scene wind is from 050 at 3 knots.  Forecast wind is 090 at 10 knots.  NOAA SSC Ed Levine consulted with Louisiana State University, CHEMTREC, and MASS (NOAA Seattle) concerning reactivity of the chemicals.  The consensus is that in proper proportions, the two chemicals could react violently.  The chloroacetic acid is heated during transport (freezing point is 143 degrees F).  Charleston Fire Department personnel are presently on the deck of the vessel.  USCG district 7."

    "description": "In the early morning of August 11, 1993, a vapor cloud was seen moving over the Columbus Street Terminal in Charleston, SC.  The cloud seemed to be coming from the deck of the 939-foot container vessel Newark Bay.  The ship carried two 5,000-gallon intermodal tanks; one tank contained acetaldehyde oxime (CAS 107-29-9), the other chloroacetic acid (CAS 79-11-8).  Either chemical could have caused the vapor cloud and, since the tanks were stacked one on top of the other, it was not initially known which was on top.  These chemicals are incompatible and if they had combined in the proper proportions, there could have been a violent reaction. The Charleston Fire Department (FD) HAZMAT team performed the initial site survey in Level A protection from a crane that hoisted them over the deck of the ship.   No vapor cloud was visible and neither tank appeared to be leaking.  The FD HAZMAT team later determined that chloroacetic acid was leaking from a faulty valve on the top IMO tank, but no acetaldehyde oxime had been released.  A six-inch hairline crack in the outer insulation skin of the container was also discovered.  The vessel's owners accepted full responsibility for the discharge and hired local cleanup contractors.  The tank owners (Hoyer USA, Inc.) hired a marine surveyor to examine the tank's structural integrity and determine the cause of the failure. The on-scene weather was mild, winds one-half to three knots, with afternoon winds forecast to be nine to ten knots. The USCG activated the AST and GST.  USCG district 7.

    "description": "On August 10, 1993, at approximately 0545, the freighter Balsa 37, the barge Ocean 255, and the barge Bouchard 155 collided in the shipping channel west of the Skyway Sunshine Bridge south of Mullet Key in Tampa Bay, FL.  MSO Tampa closed the port to vessel traffic.  This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel was burning out of control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow spilling approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay. Stabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.  By 2200 the Ocean 255 barge fire was extinguished and the GST was conducting cooling procedures and maintaining a fire watch.  Lightering operations were well underway on the Bouchard 155 barge in preparation for moving it to dockage in the Port of Tampa where it would be cleaned before dry docking.  The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations were conducted. August 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during the surf washing. By August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies, forecasts, and planning. Meanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees. The GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and lightering of the Ocean 255 barge. Roughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls, and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune Key in fringing mangroves. Seawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure hot-water washes.  PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the RP decided against its use. Cleanup of submerged tarmats offshore is ongoing.  NOAA is working with the  RRT, the GST, the Army Corps of Engineers, the FOSC, State officials, and various scientists and engineers to develop a sound method for dealing with the tarmats.  Additional on-scene participation by NOAA is anticipated.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: sorbent pompoms, high-pressure warm-water washes, sorbent boom."

In addition to the fire, there was concern for the potential release of 5,000 pounds of anhydrous ammonia and 100 pounds of freon contained in storage and piping of the freezer unit of the facility.  Initially a one and a half-mile safety zone was established and all businesses and residences within a one-mile radius of the facility were evacuated.  The following morning, the safety zone was reduced to 500 yards.  The Anacortes Fire Department was unable to put the fire out until most of the dock and buildings collapsed into the water.  A small plume of ammonia was released when this occurred.  Personnel evacuated from the area were allowed to return the evening of July 27 when the fire was declared under control.

    "description": "On June 21, 1993, the USCG MSO in Philadelphia received a report from a tug boat captain through the National Response Center of an oil sheen in the Schuylkill River.  The sheen size was reportedly 200 feet by 1/2 mile.  At the time of the report the air temperature was 85?F, skies were overcast, and winds were southwest at 10 to 15 knots. A Marine Environmental Protection Team went to the scene and traced the source of the sheen to the former CELOTEX facility.  The MSO hired cleanup contractors for this federally funded cleanup; the facility owner refused to take responsibility.   Contractors placed boom in the water and began steam cleaning bulkheads, riprap, and pilings.  Oil-soaked soil leaking through a bulkhead proved to be the source of the slick. Found on the site were twenty-three tanks containing unknown product and sludge, three unmarked drums, bags of asbestos waste, hundreds of bales of shredded paper and other garbage, and two five-inch artillery shells.  Two tanks were unstable and many were without tops or had holes cut in them. The USCG contacted the Philadelphia Bomb Squad to remove the artillery shells and was contacted by the Philadelphia Environmental Crimes Unit concerning other possible legal infractions at the site.  An incident-specific RRT was convened.  It took two months to stabilize the site for possible hand-off to State or Federal EPA for long-term site remediation.  USCG district 5.

The major black product is contained at the east end of the Waterway with heavy rainbow sheen and emulsified oil scattered throughout the Waterway.  Some light sheen escaped into Commencement Bay.  Cleanup operations are concentrated in six locations: -Heavy product at the ship and dock. -Moderate to light impacted beachs at the SE end of Blair Waterway. -Pockets of product at the Weyerhauser Pier. -Pockets of product at the Blair Pier. -Pockets of heavy sheen at the AK-WA Shipyard. -Pockets of heavy sheen at two marinas at the mouth of Blair Waterway.  Two skimming vessels and one portable disk skimmer are on-scene with an additional skimming vessel expected Thursday evening. Primary resources of concern include smolts outmigrating from the Puyallup River which will be congregating in the waterways in the next several weeks to months.  Migrating Canadian Geese and other waterfowl are present in the area as well.  Washington Dept. of Fisheries, Dept. of Wildlife personnel, and a Puyallup Indian Tribal representative are on scene working with the Federal (USCG) and State (WA Dept. of Ecology) On Scene Coordinators in prioritizing protection and cleanup strategies and beginning resource damage assessment evaluation.  The NOAA SSC plans to conduct beach surveys and overflights with resource agencies during periods of low tide on Friday.  NOAA personnel on-scene: Sharon Christopherson  USCG district 13."

Approximately 200 gallons of IFO 380 was spilled into the Blair Waterway.  It was later determined that approximately 4,000 gallons of fuel were spilled into the water, 1,500 gallons were contained on the deck, and 14,000 gallons were spilled and contained in the engine room bilges when a valve broke.  Personnel from the barge supplying the fuel quickly deployed a boom around the vessel to contain the spill and began skimming the oil.  At 2030, a shoreline survey found a 3,000-foot section of the northeast waterway shoreline covered with a two-foot wide ribbon of oil.  An overflight the following morning saw pockets of black oil trapped at the east end of the waterway, with heavy rainbow sheen and emulsified oil scattered throughout Blair Waterway.  A small quantity of light sheen was also seen in Commencement Bay.  Through a combination of southwest winds and a series of deflection booms deployed along the north shoreline, the majority of the oil was contained in the east end of the waterway where it either beached or was recovered. Recovery of pockets of free floating oil was completed April 27.  Active cleaning of impacted shorelines was completed May 2.  Passive cleaning using snare booms (pompoms) deployed along the more heavily impacted shoreline continued until June 1.  USCG district 13.

Pollution investigators confirmed the spill and overflight personnel reported that a marsh to the east of the spill site had been impacted.  UNOCAL initially reported that 100 barrels had been released, but USCG overflight personnel estimated the spill at 1,000 barrels.  The final calculation by UNOCAL was 2,100 barrels.  The spill location was boomed and UNOCAL hired four contractors to cleanup the marsh. The cause of the spill may have been valve failure while crude was being transferred from a holding tank on the facility to an off-site tank.  Reports indicated that the transfer may have been switched to an inappropriate pipeline, which subsequently overflowed.  There were no alarms on the system. UNOCAL immediately accepted responsibility for the incident and the cleanup of the impacted river banks and marsh.  Cleanup activities were monitored by MSO Port Arthur until April 25, 1993, when the FOSC turned final oversight function over to Texas General Land Office personnel.  USCG district 8.

At 1145 EST, the vessel's position was 34 degrees 2 minutes North, 076 degrees 42 minutes West and drifting towards 247 degrees.  Crew were put back aboard the vessel sometime during the night, dropping the anchor at about 0230 EST on 27 January.  The vessel is reported to be stable at 33 degrees 37 minutes North, 077 degrees 16 minutes West. Today, offshore winds are expected to be N at 40-50 knots with seas of 16-22 feet.  Wednesday night, offshore winds are expected to be NW at 30 knots with seas of 7-12 feet.  USCG district 5."

It is believed that a tank had been overfilled and when the security guard drove near it, a spark caused the explosion.  The tank contained approximately 4,500,000 gallons of gasoline.  Unburned product was contained in the berm area around the tank farm.  Steuart Petroleum is located in the Jacksonville Port Terminal and the St. Johns River runs within 1,000 feet of it. The Jacksonville Fire Department responded to the fire and, in addition to land-side fire-fighting equipment, a fire-fighting boat was stationed on the St. Johns River as a precaution. The USCG COTP Jacksonville, closed the channel from the Trout River Inlet through the southern end of the Long Branch range the morning of January 2.  Later that day, the channel was opened to one-way traffic that was restricted to the east side. The fire department transferred product from the damaged tank to other tanks and the damaged tank was continuously cooled throughout the operation.  The fire was on top of the tank so the fire fighters blanketed that area with aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) attempting to smother the fire.  To maintain the integrity of the tank, water was continuously pumped into it keeping the level constant.  The resulting water-foam mixture was pumped from the berm area into the St. Johns River to sustain the necessary berm containment volume from January 4 until January 7 when the fire department declared the fire out. On January 6, all water was drained from the tank and pure foam was introduced at both the top and bottom to completely extinguish the flames.  A protective blanket of foam was placed on top of it, and a reflash watch was maintained throughout the night.  The fire was declared out at 1400 on January 7.  USCG district 7.  Keyword: none."

At 0900 a USCG overflight located the rig and reported that the release of natural gas, hydrogen sulfide, and a condensate of crude oil was ongoing and a boat on the upwind side of the rig was applying water to the diverter to cool it down.  ARCO personnel on a rig less than one mile northeast of the blowout were prepared to evacuate in case of a wind shift. The slick tended to the southwest (approximately 220?).  It was reported to be one to one and a half mile long and two to three hundred yards wide consisting mostly of a condensate.  Rainbow and lighter sheen extended from one and a half to nine and a half miles from the rig.  The smell of hydrogen sulfide was detected up to ten miles downwind.  The amount of oil in the water appeared to be minimal. An exclusion zone was established within a ten-mile radius of the well because of the hydrogen sulfide gas threat.

The SSC participated in two overflights, produced several overflight maps, and provided graphic representation of oil fate and weather effects (evaporation). NOAA told responders that the cold air and water temperatures could cause the spilled diesel to persist longer on the water's surface resulting in higher potential for dissolution and dispersion of lighter fractions into the water column.

The wind was out of the southeast at 10 to 12 knots and there were two-foot seas at the time of the report.  At 0830 a Minerals Management Service (MMS) aircraft happened to fly over the area and reported a three-mile slick tending to the northeast.  The contents of the barge, the quantity of fuel on the tug, the product seen in the water, and the source of the leak were unknown. The well was owned by South Parish Oil, a bankrupt company, and was thought to be a shut-in well, not a production well.  The report of a collision by a tug with barges was unconfirmed and thought to be erroneous. Overflights by private aircraft later in the day were unable to locate the source of the spill.  The only beach impact reported was a stretch north of the site estimated from the air to be about 100 feet long and two feet wide with light sheen trailing downwind.  Reports from CONOCO engineers indicated that the oil probably came from a leaky valve and was considered only a minor problem. A front was moving through the area causing wave action that hid any oil on the surface making acquisition of information from overflights impossible.  The water was dark brown and the skies were overcast adding to the difficulty of aircrews to spot the spill.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: none."

The fire developed in a storage compartment where thousands of cardboard boxes are stored, all coated with wax. 3. The vessel has 900 mT of fuel--diesel, heavy oil, hydraulic  and lube oil, and has 10 mT of ammonia in a large tank one deck below the compartment of smoldering cardboard.  Action: 1. The compartment with the fire was immediately closed off on Sunday reducing the condition to a smoldering mass of cardboard. 2. On Monday, an attempt was made to open the compartment and flood it with water, but the fire flashed back  That tack was halted and the compartment was resealed and has remained that way to the present, Thursday night, leaving only smoldering, flameless cardboard. 3. The Coast Guard has contracted Boots and Coots to fight the fire, and they arrived in Dutch Harbor this afternoon, Thursday, Oct. 29. 4. B&C's will evaluate the situation, and on Friday, Oct. 30 will probably attempt to overwhelm the smoldering fire. 5. Considerable concern has been directed to the potential fate of the 10 mT of ammonia which could possibly explosively release if the tank was heated by an out-of-control fire. 6. On Thursday morning, the SSC consulted with a host of players in Seattle-Mass Nir, Ed Overton, Bob, and more, to discuss the situation.  Most techniques of cooling the ammonia tank, surrounding it with a non-flammable atmosphere and venting it to the air or water were discussed.  USCG district 17."

    "description": "The rig caught on fire at approximately 1200 CST.  The fire initially was burning oil and gas, but the oil fire went out after a short time. Although the fire appears not to be damaging the rig, one person was injured due to burns.  Debra Simecek-Beaty, NOAA, overflew over the spill area (H-65) from 1220 to 1320.  On scene winds were about 15 knots from the NE.  The rig was on fire and a slick extended from the rig to the western end of East Timbalier Island.  The slick contained mostly silver and rainbow sheen with a narrow band of dark colored streamers.  Burn residue was also observed in the slick.  Shoreline impacts on East Timbalier Island extended from the western tip and along the northern shore to the radio tower.  No impacts were observed east of the radio tower.  Two subsequent overflights mapped the shoreline features in greater detail since there had been more than a dozen breaks in the island due to Huricane Andrew.  Winds had increased to greater than 20 knots and a significant sea swell was forming, resulting in 5 -7 foot breakers on the Gulf side of the island.  Although visibility had diminished due to the lower sun angle, it appeared that the amount of oiling in the marshes had decreased significantly.  Only one small pocket of black pooled oil was observed in contrast to yesterday. The oil did not appear from the overflight to have undergone any significant emulsification.  A flight restricted zone with a radius of 5 miles and an altitude of 3000 feet was established around the rig at 1511 for all non- response aircraft.  The zone restriction will last for 6 hours.  The 36 inch boom that was deployed around the rig was destroyed in the fire.  The Coast Guard has deployed two more booms to the west of the rig.  The Coast Guard was unable to deploy the Open Water Containment and Recovery System (OWOCRS) because the water is too shallow.  USCG district 8.

The initial call to report the spill  was to EPA and the NRC where there was some confusion as to whether the  spill was in the inland or coastal zone.  By approximately 1200 on the same day,  MSO Portland was contacted, briefed by the EPA personnel on scene and asked  to take over as the On-Scene Coordinator for a coastal response.  Two MSO  personnel were dispatched.  Situation: It was estimated that 5,000 gallons of the spilled product remained on land and  that 4,000 gallons made it into the Penopscot River about the time of high tide.  The NOAA SSC was contacted as approximately 1300.  It was determined that the threat to aquatic life in the Penopscot River had, for the most part,  subsided, given that the spill had occurred some 12 hours earlier on a falling tide.   It was thought that the chemical would have an acute toxic effect and would  dilute as it moved down the river becoming a diluted, non-toxic solution.  Concern was expressed that the chemical might stay together as a plume for a  distance down river, but that within 12-24 hours the bulk of the product would be  diluted sufficiently.  The MSO was warned to expect a possible localized fish kill  and to be aware of the odor of chlorine down river of the spill (which would  indicate that the product had not completely diluted).

The product (BRC-17) was discharged from ullage and into the Delaware River.   Initially, eight miles of the river bank, two miles of Woodbury Creek, and small boats in the area were oiled. The weather was overcast with building thunderheads, temperature 81?F, water temperature 67?F, winds from the west at seven to nine knots, and calm seas. Terminal personnel were having difficulty deploying boom at Fort Mifflin dock, so the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) sent personnel in a small boat to help.   Cleanup contractors were hired and helped double boom the vessel at the scene.  By July 5, cleanup of oil and vessels at the site continued and the contractor, Atlantic Strike Team, and USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) personnel were cleaning up the New Jersey riverbank. Impacts were also reported in Big Timber, Woodbury, and Manuta creeks.  Snares and absorbent wipes were ineffective during nighttime deployment.  Only 17 birds were observed in slightly distressed condition from light oiling; however, they remained active and uncatchable. The response lasted approximately one month.  USCG district 5.

There are two cars in the water:; an LPG tank car and a tank car carrying an aromatic concentration of mostly benzene( 45%) and dicyclopentadiene(13%) with assorted other hydrocarbons. A total of 15,000 gallons has already leaked out with a potential of 35,000 gallons total(no sourc for estimate). We don't know if the product is still leaking or the location of hole.  The river at the location of the bridge is fairly shallow with a depth of only 7 feet. The flow rate is above average( 830,000 gpm) which means it will quickly flush any of the spilled product into the Superior harbor basin. The water in Superior Bay itself is probably fairly stagnant with a high turbidity. Residence times for water in the northern part of the bay is  several days.  USCG district 9.

MSO personnel arrived on scene at 1545 and estimated that 100 barrels were in the water and around the tank battery.  An unknown quantity remained in the sludge pit.  Mechanical cleanup operations were initiated by MSO personnel. There was no measurable evaporation taking place.   The mineral oil product covered various areas up to five miles away from the tank battery.  Mechanical cleanup was nearly impossible because the area was so shallow.  The currents and tides moved the product out of the area and into the open Gulf very slowly. Cleanup was not completed until April 16, 1992, because secondary leaks were detected in pipelines leading to the tank battery.  USCG district 8.  Keyword: none."

    "description": "On January 26, 1992, the tugs De Lasalle and Scaup reported a collision between their respective tows at mile marker (mm) 108 of the Intracoastal Waterway  (ICWW).  The collision caused a breach in the upper one-third of the #1 port cargo tank of the styrene barge being towed by De Lasalle.  The breach in the styrene tank initially released an unknown quantity of styrene into the waterway.  When the damaged barge was pushed to the embankment of the ICWW and released by the tug, the damaged tank dropped below the water and released a great deal more of the styrene.  The tank was capable of holding 115,000 gallons, but was carrying only about 89,857 gallons. The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) promptly closed the ICWW from mm 105 to mm 110.  Booms were deployed west (downcurrent) of the spill site, and later, to the east of the site to delay any possible incursion into the Wax Lake area. For approximately ten days after the spill, the weather was overcast, with heavy to light rain, temperatures in the mid to low 50s, winds out of the northeast shifting to the north at 10 to 15 knots.  This type of weather allowed the polymerization of the product to slow to the point where there was still appreciable styrene monomer on the water after eight or nine days.  USCG district 8.

The EVER GRACE is carrying 57,670 kgs. (127,139 lbs, 17882 gals) of Allyl Alcohol  in three 20' containers, and the ship's agent reported a possible source as a 20  ton tank container.  MSO Baltimore was notified of a possible leak at 1300 EST,  Jan. 24.  The vessel is currently 180 miles SW of Cape Henry.  The vessel is headed for Baltimore from Houston with the cargo of Allyl Alcohol's ultimate  destination to be France.  SSC Gary Ott is on scene at MSO Hampton Roads.  The  initial evaluation by NOAA points out that although the material is poisonous,  flammability is the higher risk problem (flash point is 70 degrees Farhenheit), and further evaluations should be conducted with the measure of flammability as  a priority with the toxicity issue considered second in importance to that. The worst case scenario of a very large puddle of the material would have a IDLH  zone of 26 yards due to the low vapor pressure of Allyl Alcohol (17 mmHg at 20  degrees Celsius).  Allyl Alcohol is an intense irritant to the skin, eyes, nose  and throat, it causes burns on contact and is poisonous in small quantities. The lethal dose is approximately 1 ounce for a 150 lb. person. The material has good warning properties with extreme tearing of the eyes as an indicator. Other materials of a lower priority to be considered include P.Chlorobenzoyl Chloride of which there are 66 drums on the vessel.  Gary Ott's first meeting with the pilot at the pilot house is at 1730 EST before  going to the vessel.  The EVER GRACE is scheduled to anchor at 2CH buoy, north  of Cape Charles, Virginia.

Approximately 8,000 gallons of intermediate fuel oil was spilled by the motor vessel Tai Chung, a bulk aluminum oxide carrier, during bunkering operations from a fuel barge tied up next to it.  The spill occurred during the ebb tide under calm wind conditions. The vessel owner, Taiwan Navigation Company Limited, accepted responsibility for the cleanup.  Boom was deployed around the vessel within the first three hours of the spill, and cleanup of the free-floating oil and oiled shoreline began on December 28, continuing until February 5.  Cleanup operations were monitored by USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) Portland pollution investigators and two members of the USCG Pacific Strike Team in close coordination with representatives from Oregon's departments of Environmental Quality and Fish and Game.

The barge suffered two holes in the hull near the #1 starboard tank spilling 450 barrels of unleaded gasoline.  The spill was carried to the west by wind and currents.  No recovery was attempted due to the volatile nature of the product.  Evaporative loss of over 50 percent was expected within the first hour, and 90 percent evaporation was expected by morning.

The vessel, Pard I, was near the release working on an underwater pipeline crack for CONOCO.  The weather at the scene was calm, temperature 81?F, winds south-southwest 12 to 13 knots, seas 1 to 2 feet, with visibility 3 miles and decreasing due to fog. The incident took place during the early-morning hours, but was not reported until late afternoon.  The lateness of the report was probably caused by reduced visibility because of early-morning fog that restricted the ability of aircraft to spot the spill.  MSO Morgan City reported that CONOCO personnel reported at 1600 that the spill was caused by a break in a CONOCO pipeline and estimated the amount of product spilled at five gallons.  In actuality, the spill, based on initial overflight reports, was probably 300 to 600 gallons. CONOCO brought in CONOCO response personnel, Clean Gulf, Riedel Peterson, and Petroleum Helicopter, Inc. (PHI).  By the next morning, there were skimmers, one 25-foot pontoon boat, two 16-foot flat boats, one 21-foot response boat, 1,000 feet of six-inch sorbent boom, miscellaneous cleanup equipment, and PHI helicopters on scene or en route.  The weather had become favorable to the cleanup effort in that the wind was out of the north at about 20 miles per hour with gusts to 25 miles per hour and seas at three to five feet.  The cleanup operation was completed on December 13 when overflights confirmed that there was no visible sign of pollution in the water or on the shore.  USCG district 8.

Coast Guard (USCG) Marine Safety Office (MSO) Honolulu received a report from the USCG Cutter Sassafras of a strong odor of diesel near their berth on Sand Island in Honolulu Harbor.  USCG pollution investigators identified the tank vessel Yupex, as the source of the spill.  The Yupex is a small Panamanian-flagged tanker owned by a Korean company that provides fuel to fishing fleets.  While taking on fuel at the Pacific Resources Incorporated (PRI) terminal at pier 29, a valve was left partially open allowing diesel being loaded into the tanker's #1 ballast tanks to leak out into the harbor.  The diesel continued to leak as the vessel transited to pier 35 where it docked to take on more cargo. An independent marine surveyor gauged the tanks on board the Yupex and found 21,500 gallons less than what the vessel reported to have on board when it left pier 29.   The Yupex had also filed a protest with the PRI terminal indicating that they received 5,000 gallons less diesel than the terminal claims they pumped.  On the basis of this information, the USCG estimated that the volume of diesel spilled was about 25,000 gallons. Cleanup was initiated at 0700 on November 20 by the USCG contractor Pacific Environmental Corporation (PENCO).  The vessel's owners accepted responsibility for the cleanup later the same day.

The canal drains directly to the Cape Fear River constituting discharge of oil into U.S. waters.  Monitoring wells were placed near the site of the leaching to determine the extent and source of the plume.  Analysis of the groundwater monitoring data revealed a plume of oil that stretched from the site of leaching upslope below a nearby pump pit and below the nearest storage tank (tank 13).  MSO Wilmington is responding to an oil pollution incident at the City Gas and Transmission Corp., Wilmington, NC, an abandoned oil and waste oil facility.  Oil is leaking at a low rate into a drainage ditch and then into the Cape Fear River. The responsible party has also terminated maintenance of a recovery well located about five feet from the edge of the drainage ditch.  Pumps had been used to remove floating oil from the well while depressing the local ground water level .  This had prevented oil from leaching into the drainage ditch. The facility has approximately 15-20 tanks with concrete bottoms. Some sludges in 55 gallon drums have been observed on the site. Oil contamination of soils and potential contamination of underground waters has been estimated as high as 100,000 gallons. (the methods used for this estimate are not known).

    "description": "On October 15, 1991, between 2000 and 2200 hours (CT) an estimated 2100 gallons of waste oil was spilled on the Neches River at approximately 30-01 N 094-02 W.  The spill was possibly from bilge pumping.  The identity of the spiller is unknown at this time.  The spilled waste oil is suspected to have been treated with bilge cleaner by the spiller. The spilled oil initially impacted approximately 2 miles of the south bank of the Neches River.  The impact was in pockets along the shoreline and had moderately impacted some marshy areas associated with the small pockets of oil. The salinity of the river water in the vicinity of the spill is estimated at 0.1 ppt (estimate made by MSO Port Arthur).  The  current in the area of the spill is estimated at no more than 0.5 kts. On October 16, MSO Port Arthur FOSC representative, LCDR Ross Tuxhorn was contacted by the NOAA SSC at the request of the CG District 8 Marine Safety Office representative, CDR Wieczynski. At that time the FOSCR stated the problem as noted above and further requested information related to a request by the Texas General Land Office to do an experiment on a designated area of the spill with Oil Spill Eater II (an enzyme product that is advertised as a biological dispersant.  This is one of ten products that have been chosen for testing by NETAC. After consulting with the NOAA Hazmat Biological Assessment Team (Rebecca Hoff), LSU (Charlie Henry), and RPI (Jeff Dahlin), the SSC relayed the information to the FOSC verbally.  The result of the conversation was that the recommendation was that this was not a proper type of oil, or a proper area to experiment with OSE II, and that it was recommended that the experiment not be carried out on this particular spill.  The details of the consultations were put in written form by LSU and RPI and these documents were  FAXed to the FOSC and the RRT-6 members on October 16. On October 17, the FOSCR accomplished a recon of the affected area and decided to change the locations of the areas to be used for an experiment to two drainage outlets that had been affected. these outlets are owned by Dupont.  There is an estimated 15-25 gallons of the waste oil remaining in these two outlets that would be treated with the OSE II. The above change in locations was mentioned at the conference call that took place on October 17 at 1230 CT.  During the call RRT members voiced concerns over the lack of an appropriate monitoring plan, the chemistry of the waste oil, the need to acquire the  approval of the land owner to test on Dupont land, and the lack of a plan to handle the treated product in the event of flooding that would require Dupont to empty the waste oil and product into the Neches River.

The  OMNISEA was reported to have 400 pounds of chlorine, 10,000 pounds of ammonia, and 250,000 gallons of diesel onboard.  The ammonia was in the vessel's refrigeration system close to where the fire started. Under the Puget Sound Marine Firefighting Response Plan, the Seattle Fire Department became the Marine Firefighting Scene Commander (FFSC).  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) provided technical assistance and established a 250-yard safety zone on the water side of the vessel.  The response was upgraded to a five-alarm fire, and at one time included over 60 pieces of shore-based equipment, 2 Seattle fire boats, and 2 tugs. The vessel developed an 8-degree starboard list as a result of the large volume of water continuously being sprayed on her.  To reduce the list and stabilize the vessel, a barge was brought in to contain the water pumped from the OMNISEA.  USCG district 13."

Approximately half of the pipeline's potential 1,000 barrels of South Texas sweet crude oil entered the Intracoastal Waterway about 1 1/2 nautical miles north-northeast of High Island.  The oil flowed west to the slip where the barge that had been loading was moored.  A hard boom was placed in the slip and several more were positioned across the Intracoastal Waterway to keep oil from entering East Bay.  The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) ordered the Intracoastal Waterway closed to all traffic and authorized placing hard boom across it in several locations.

    "description": "NOAA was notified of the incident on August 14, 1991, by the FOSC who requested that the NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC) attend all meetings pertaining to the removal of the barges and provide scientific support throughout the operation.  A NOAA technical support team reported on-scene to assist the SSC. The NOAA support team surveyed the site and collected five water column samples and five shoreline samples for analysis. NOAA reported that there are many species of birds, fish, snakes, and mammals in the area, as well as alligators.  NOAA recommended that the spartina not be cut. The SSC told the FOSC that the pollutants should not spread rapidly because of the location of the barges, the shape of the cut, and the fact that the wind is the primary influence over the localized currents.   NOAA recommended using a bubble curtain if a water-soluble product was released into the water column.  NOAA suggested containing all the product within the far end of the canal in which the barges were located. In addition, four paddle-wheel aerators should be placed diagonally across from each other to generate a circular current within the containment area.  NOAA also recommended damming the cut where the barges were located.  If polychlorinated biphenyls or Aroclor were onboard the barges, as suspected, removing sediments could be necessary in the event of a major release. There probably was a spill of around 300 gallons from the Z-62 barge.   According to chemistry analyses from the site, there were at least three different types of oils in the sediment.  The water column was clean.  Samples of the barge's product are being analyzed.  It will not be possible to determine the extent of the spill on the area until the analyses of these samples are completed and compared to the sediment samples. The disposal of these barges is an ongoing effort and has been halted due to a lack of funds.  Efforts are being made to acquire funding through the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.  To date, all requests have been rejected for the funds needed to complete this cleanup.  USCG district 8."

Containment boom was deployed around the barge by Coastal and personnel were dispatched to clean-up the oil. Coastal Barge and Towing accepted full responsibility for the incident and made arrangements for the entire clean-up.   Overflights were performed both by the Fl. Marine Patrol and the Coast Guard. Initially the slick was reported to be approx. 30 miles long by 100 yds wide, but ground-truthing later during the day revealed that a majority of the reported oil was really some type of brown algae.   By the end of the day clean-up operations were complete. A evening overflight by the Fl Marine Patrol was completed with negative sightings of oil.   The Coast Guard determined the source of the barge leak to be a broken 2 inch containment drain line. They estimate less than 100 gallons of oil was lost.   The Pennecamp State Park biologist surveyed the shoreline form Point Willie south for approx. one mile. She found three small areas where there was minimal impact. No damage is expected from the impacts.  USCG district 7."

Ten to fifteen minutes after the collision, the Tenyo Maru sank in an estimated 350 feet of water.  The Tenyo Maru, carrying 6,500 barrels of intermediate fuel oil, 2,166 barrels of diesel oil, and some quantity of lube, bilge and fish oils, began leaking oil shortly after it sank.  There were conflicting reports of the weather at the time of the collision, several reports claiming that the weather was clear, while others maintained that it was foggy. The incident occurred in Canadian waters very near the Canadian/United States boundary.  The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) implemented the Canadian/U. S. Joint Marine Pollution Contingency Plan.  Since the spill occurred in Canadian waters, the CCG took the lead role in coordinating the spill response.  Ultimately, the majority of shoreline oiling occurred in the United States.  The USCG federalized the U.S. cleanup effort, accessing funding through the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, on July 30 when the owner of the Tenyo Maru discontinued funding the cleanup. The Tenyo Maru continued to leak oil after it sank, with the largest amount released shortly after the sinking.  Response to the incident continued into late August.  The bulk of the response effort was scaled down by August 29, as the amount of oil being released from the sunken vessel on a daily basis had reduced significantly.  The Canadian and U.S. Coast Guard planned to monitor the spill site for at least another month with regularly scheduled overflights and beach surveys as warranted.  USCG district 13.

When the DYNACHEM attempted to anchor and hook up to the #2 mooring, a hydraulic winch failed and caused the ship to abort the attempt and weigh anchor.  The #3 mooring pipeline was severed when it was snagged by the starboard anchor. The ship was not damaged nor at risk and moved off and anchored at a safe distance. At the time of the accident there was a maximum potential of 7,320 barrels of gas-oil in the pipeline (a combination of the 26-inch cargo transfer line and a 12-inch line in a looped configuration). The gas-oil, a non-marketable diesel-like product, is used to push remaining product out of the 26-inch line after tankers have finished transferring their cargo.  It is left unpressurized in the looped lines after transfer operations are completed. Terminal personnel were notified about 10 minutes after the mishap and immediately began pumping the gas-oil out of the severed line. Chevron hired Clean Coastal Waters as their primary response contractor and the U.S. Coast Guard requested four skimmers from the U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage and U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Strike Team personnel with an offshore skimming barrier.  The Clean Seas Cooperative was requested to standby to provide any additional assistance necessary.  33-54.3 N and 118-26.8 W  USCG district 11."

    "description": "NOAA was notified of the incident on February 4, 1991, by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO) Hampton Roads.  MSO was particularly interested in knowing the potential reaction of methanol if it combined with the other chemicals in the event of an explosion. NOAA told MSO that the immediate threat would be a large fire involving methanol if the pipe bomb could not be defused.  NOAA also advised that oxide gases could be produced from the liquid fertilizer if the bombs detonated.  NOAA suggested evacuating people from the area to at least a half mile away. NOAA established an information center at the USCG Reserve Training Center, Yorktown where a meeting of federal and state agencies involving emergency spill planning was in progress.  Representatives of the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR), the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Public Health, and the Virginia Department of Emergency Services provided immediate response information on-scene and agreed that the response should be handled by local fire officials. Local fire officials established an evacuation zone of one mile from the facility.  All the pipe bombs were removed and defused from the tanks without further incident.  USCG district 5."

BELGUIM's tank barge DC 353, loaded with 10,500 barrels of 1,1,1-trichloroethane, was damaged and grounded on an island at mile marker 210 about 8 miles south of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The barge was lying on her port side with cargo leaking from one of the wing tanks at an unknown rate. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) from the Marine Safety Office (MSO), New Orleans closed the river temporarily between mile markers 215 and 150 until the loose barges could be brought under control.   The river was also closed between mile markers 212 and 210 to prevent further damage to DC 353 by the wakes of passing vessels.  On January 10, Dow Chemical Company response personnel arrived on-scene to assess DC 353's condition.  River conditions and stormy weather hampered activities and threatened further damage to the barge.  USCG district 8."

STAR #6 was reported to be 195 feet long, 35 feet wide, and 10 feet deep and carrying 225,000 gallons of 50 percent solution caustic soda.  RHINO later reported that the STAR #6 had sunk in approximately 32 feet of water at the mouth of the Mobile Ship Channel about 6 1/2 miles east of Dauphin Island, 30 miles south of Mobile starboard side down, and her port side above the water   Reports also indicated that small amounts of cargo were being released. The apparent cause of the mishap was a collision that had occurred while the vessels were departing Mobile and the failure of a deteriorated hull in the areas of STAR's flotation voids.  Reportedly, the barge had been sent out with known leaks and portable pumps in the Intracoastal Waterway.  The portable pumps reportedly ran out of fuel or failed and a safe return to Mobile was prevented by limited visibility in fog and heavy weather.  USCG district 8."

The program did not identify the source of the spill, but showed birds, including a blue heron, fishing the area.  The news report indicated that the spill was large, possibly major.  U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel tried to verify the story, without success, beyond identifying the general area of the spill as the Vinton Canal near where it enters the Intracoastal Waterway.  Public interest in the spill was intense.  The USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) Port Arthur, Texas continued to receive telephone calls about a spill on the canal covering an area as large as 2 miles long and shore-to-shore in the approximately 100-foot wide cut.  USCG investigators from the Marine Safety Detachment (MSD) Lake Charles, Louisiana were unable to verify the spill.  A second investigative team from MSO Port Arthur arrived at the canal near midnight and discovered a yellow and green patchy substance but reported that it did not appear to be oil.  Results of samples forwarded to a local oil company laboratory were confused and did not specifically identify the sample as oil.  Strike team members were called out because of the interest generated by the news stories.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "At about 2200 EST on 17 November, a release of between 1000 and 2000 bbl of asphalt slux occured from a pipeline at the Steuart Petroleum barge loading facility located at the mouth of Piney Point Creek, Potomac River, near St. Marys, MD (NOAA chart 12233).  The product spilled was originally thought to be an ethyl based cutter stock, but persistant efforts by Ken Carney of LSU enabled him to determine the actual product by 0300, 18 November. Pour point of the asphalt slux is between 40 50 degrees F. and it is neutrally buoyant in water. SSC Gary Ott was notified at 0200 18 November.  At about 1030, on a commercial overflight, he observed no oil outside th mouth of Piney Point Creek.  He arrived on-scene at 1530, 18 November.  About 200 yards of the SE side of Piney Point Creek is oiled to a maximum width of 40 yards.  The wind is presently holding the asphalt against the shoreline and boom against the asphalt.  Boom has also been placed at the pipeline break and at the mouth of Piney Point Creek.  USCG district 1."

    "description": "The barge, Northerly Islander, located at 35deg 46'N,75deg 32'W has a potential of leaking 41,000 gallons of diesel and 1600 gallons of lube oil.  The barge went aground at about 01:30 EDT on October 26th. At this time the barge is not leaking product.  If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. 1) TRAJECTORY  The forecasted winds will tend to dominate the transport processes and we would expect that the winds will move the product in a southerly direction. If a spill were to occur and persist over a tidal cycle, it is likely that both the inside and outside of northern Pea Island will be threatened.  If the diesel is released, there maybe a toxic shock to bivalves.  The lube oil may coat the eel grass beds on the inside of Pea Island and we would expect a minimal amount of lube oil impacting the sandy beaches on the outer island.  Tomorrow morning, the winds are forecasted from the west and the wind speed will begin to drop off.  The threat area would still remain the same with a slight increase in product impacting the outside of Pea Island  USCG district 5."

    "description": "At 0845 on September 16, 1990, the tank vessel Jupiter caught fire and exploded during offloading operations at the Total Oil Company refinery on the Saginaw river near Bay City, Michigan.  A wake from a passing bulk carrier apparently caused the parting of the Jupiter's  transfer hose, grounding cable, and all but one of its mooring lines.  Residual gasoline in the broken transfer hose was believed to have been ignited by a spark on the dock.  The Jupiter's  stern swung around into the Saginaw River and grounded perpendicular to the direction of the river flow.  The grounding resulted in a crack in the vessel's hull from the manifold on the starboard side to 75 feet aft of the manifold on the port side. Area marinas were evacuated and vessel traffic was halted.  Bangor County Fire Department and USCG personnel arrived on-scene within 30 minutes of the incident.  The pier fire was extinguished in an attempt to save the last mooring line while the fire onboard the vessel remained out of control.  Williams Boots & Coots Company (WB&C) from Houston, Texas, was contracted to fight the fire due to the lack of locally available trained personnel and equipment.  At 1315 on September 17, WB&C personnel extinguished the blaze by applying foam.  Carbon black accumulations falling from the overhead re-ignited the fire at 2300.  This second blaze was cooled with water and extinguished with foam on September 18.  WB&C personnel also applied foam inside the vessel's cargo tanks to prevent re-ignition of the vessel. River flow data were obtained from the Army Corps of Engineers to predict the oil movement.  Shock waves from the explosion may have contributed to the deaths of several fish that were recovered from around the vessel.  Neither pollution nor shoreline contamination was observed during the final survey of the area on October 22.  USCG district 9.

Tank farm personnel had improperly aligned the valves on the shoreside piping, allowing cargo to enter a full tank and rupture it.

    "description": "On July 28, 1990, at 1430, the Greek Tank Vessel Shinoussa collided with the tank barges Apex 3417 and Apex 3503 in the Houston Ship Channel (HSC) near buoy 58 in Galveston Bay, Texas.  All three cargo tanks of the Apex 3417 were damaged, as well as the aft tank of the Apex 3503, resulting in the release of nearly 17,000 barrels of  No. 5 oil (vacuum oil/catalytic feed stock) into Galveston Bay.  A third tank barge also under tow, the Apex 3510, was not damaged in the collision.  The Apex 3417 sank with its stern resting on the bottom of the channel and only its bow showing above the water.  It released nearly all of its cargo, over 15,000 barrels of oil, over the course of two days.  Apex 3503 was less damaged and ultimately released 1130 barrels of oil into the water.  The Apex 3510 was towed to Houston, discharged its 23,000 barrel cargo, and returned on July 30 to offload the remaining oil from the Apex 3503.  The USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) Galveston closed the Houston Ship Channel to marine traffic from two miles north to two miles south of the incident site (between buoys 51 and 60).  Apex Towing Co., Inc. immediately accepted responsibility for the spill.  Apex hired Riedel-Peterson Environmental Services to contain the oil at the site of the barges, and T & T Marine Salvage to raise and remove the Apex 3417 barge from the channel.   On July 29, Malin Environmental was hired for additional cleanup assistance, and the Clean Gulf Association provided skimmers for use by Apex.  In a meeting with the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC), Apex was criticized for allowing the cleanup contractors to operate without direct supervision.  At the suggestion of the OSC, Apex hired O'Brien Oil Pollution Services to oversee the cleanup operations as well as Garner Environmental Services and Industrial Cleanup, Inc. for addition cleanup support. On July 30, the cargo of theApex 3503 was lightered to the Apex 3510  which was then taken to Houston for offloading.  On July 31, the HSC was opened to inbound single-width barge tows only, under positive control of the Vessel Traffic Service, and with assistance from at least one tug when proceeding past the accident site.  These traffic restrictions remained in effect until August 3.  Following the movement of Apex 3417 from the middle of the channel on August 3, the HSC was restricted to one-way traffic only, with direction of travel being reversed every 8 to 12 hours.  After cleaning, gas freeing, and welding repairs, Apex 3417 was towed to Galveston.  The HSC was opened to all ship traffic without restriction on August 10.  Cleanup operations continued until the case was closed on August 17, 1990.  USCG district 8.

The two ships were in the Gulf of Mexico, 57 miles southeast of Galveston Texas in international waters, but within the U.S. exclusive economic zone.  As a result of the explosion, a fire started in the pump room and spread to the engine room.  An estimated 100,000 barrels of Angolan Palanca crude was burned or released into the water from the Mega Borg during the next seven days.  Approximately 238 barrels of oil was discharged when the Fraqmura intentionally broke away from the Mega Borg.  Explosions on the Mega Borg, caused the stern of the ship began to settle lower in the water and list to the port side.  A continuous discharge of burning oil flowed over the aft port quarter of the ship. Less than an hour after the explosions on the Mega Borg, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) in Galveston dispatched two USCG cutters to the scene.   Weather was calm throughout the incident.

    "description": "On February 7, 1990 at 1620, the single-hull tank vessel American Trader  grounded on one of its anchors while approaching the Golden West Refining Company's offshore mooring.  Two holes were punctured in one of the vessel's cargo tanks, releasing 9458 barrels of heavy crude oil into the water approximately 1.3 miles from Huntington Beach, California. The master of the vessel immediately reported the incident to the USCG Marine Safety Office/Group Los Angeles-Long Beach (MSO/Group LA-LB).  The master moved the American Trader into deeper water one mile to the south.  The commanding officer of the MSO/Group assumed the role of the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC).  The responsible parties assumed full financial responsibility for the spill and sent representatives to the Long Beach area. Oil began to come ashore on February 8 in light concentrations around Newport Pier.  By February 9, oil was ashore at Huntington Beach; in some instances, oil in the surf zone here appeared to be in heavier concentrations than observed earlier at Newport Beach. Calm seas and fair weather for most of the response period resulted in a rapid and successful cleanup.  All of the beaches were cleaned by March 2.  The FOSC concluded all cleanup operations by April 3. The 22,000 barrels of crude remaining in the damaged cargo tank were lightered by personnel from the USCG Pacific Strike Team and the responsible party using the USCG Air-Deliverable Anti-Pollution Transfer System (ADAPTS).  By 1200 on February 9, the oil from the damaged tank plus 90,000 barrels from the mid-body tanks had been transferred into barges to decrease the draft of the vessel.  Temporary patches were applied to the holes in the hull and the American Trader was moved to an oil transfer facility in Long Beach Harbor to off-load the remaining 470,000 barrels of crude oil.  The vessel was moved to San Francisco on February 18 for drydocking and repair.  USCG district 11.

    "description": "On January 2, 1990, at approximately 0300, an Exxon underwater pipeline located at the mouth of Morse Creek discharged approximately 13,500 barrels of No. 2 heating oil into the Arthur Kill waterway between New Jersey and Staten Island, New York.  Exxon personnel notified the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) as well as other involved agencies, and activated the Clean Harbors Cooperative (Coop).  Exxon company volunteers had periodically received practical training on how to deploy boom and other Coop equipment.  This previous training expedited the decision-making process and allowed Exxon to begin response efforts immediately. Initial response efforts focused on containment of the spill as well as removal of the heaviest concentration of oil.  Environmentally sensitive areas were protected with boom and skimmers that collected the heavier concentrations of free-floating oil.  Since the incident occurred in January, few migratory birds were in the spill area.  Even so, Tri-State Bird Rescue treated over 100 oiled birds that were recovered during the incident.  Cleanup crews in the spill area found over 600 dead birds. A cleanup committee, consisting of representatives from USCG, Exxon, NOAA, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NY DEC), New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection (NJ DEP), and New York City Parks and Recreation, monitored cleanup progress until the end of active recovery.  On February 14, substantial deposits of fresh oil were found in sediments above peat areas on Pralls Island.  Trenches were dug to collect oil for vacuuming. By March 15, all areas were considered \"clean\" by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) except Pralls Island where further cleanup activity was postponed due to the arrival of wading birds that breed on the island.  Exxon received permission to apply Customblen, a nutrient enhancer for bioremediation, in this area after the fall migration.  USCG district 1.

    "description": "While under tow, the Spanish tank vessel Aragon suffered damage during a storm on December 29, 1989, approximately 360 miles off the coast of Morocco. The damage resulted in the release of approximately 175,000 barrels of Mexican Maya Crude Oil into the Atlantic Ocean, near the Madeiran archipelago. The Portuguese Navy was in charge of the response.  They monitored the initial movement of the oil until it made landfall.  Approximately three weeks after the spill, pollution occurred on the Portuguese Island of Porto Santo, with oil believed to have been from the Aragon.  This was later confirmed when oil samples were taken from the vessel. Portuguese authorities requested assistance from the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) and the European Economic Community (EEC) Task Force.  Specialists from the ITOPF and EEC Task Force recommended bringing additional equipment to the island, as there was no pollution response force already in place.

An estimated 452,400 barrels (19 million gallons) of the 1,714,300 barrels (72 million gallons) on board spilled into the sea.  The 35 crew members were rescued by the passing Soviet vessel Sarny.   Ocean currents carried the abandoned vessel south towards the Canary Islands.  A Moroccan Government Response Task Force consisting of members from the Moroccan Royal Navy, Interior Ministry, Ministry of Fisheries, and the Civil Defense Force responded to the incident.  According to a joint Spain/Morocco contingency plan, the Spanish government was prepared to provide aid if necessary.  The Moroccan government sent a formal request to the U.S. Coast Guard for technical assistance in evaluating the situation.  An Atlantic Strike Team (AST) representative was sent to the scene on January 4, 1990.  The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) provided cleanup equipment and an on-scene advisor. Smit Tak, a Dutch salvage company, repaired a 60 foot by 90 foot hole in the vessel's port side.  Early efforts to tow the damaged vessel away from the shore were hampered by 8-foot waves and high winds.  On January 1, a tug secured a line to the Khark 5  and began towing the vessel towards the Madeira Islands off Portugal as Morocco and Spain refused to allow the vessel close to their shores.  Fourteen aircraft and seven boats were used to spray detergents on the slick.

Oil leaked from a severed discharge line near the bottom of one or both of these 54,000-barrel capacity tanks.  It then overflowed the containment dike and moved toward the beach 250 feet away.  VIWAPA personnel constructed sand-based containment trenches and berms along the beach to contain the oil.  They also diverted oil to a diesel storage tank containment area.  Oil began to leak through the trenches, proceeding down the sloping base toward the shoreline.  U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) Marine Safety Office (MSO) San Juan personnel flew over the area on September 21 and estimated that approximately 48 barrels of oil had overflowed the trench and entered the harbor, impacting the sand beaches west of the facility. MSO and USCG Atlantic Area Strike Team (AST) personnel arrived on-scene on September 22.  They immediately began working with VIWAPA and contractor personnel to locate and stop the leak.  The Strike Team lowered the level of oil in the containment areas and secured the leak on September 25. The containment wall had been blown by the wind onto a ten-inch transfer pipe, rupturing the pipe.  An open valve had permitted the oil to escape through the broken pipe.  A total of 14,076 barrels escaped from this tank between September 18 and 25.  Approximately 1,000 barrels overflowed the containment area and entered the water.  Three miles of sand beaches were heavily oiled, with some impacts east of the power plant in the harbor area.  Some of the oil refloated, but local meteorological and oceanographic conditions isolated the resultant secondary impacts to previously oiled beaches.  Response efforts concentrated on the recovery and removal of the oil after it was on the beaches.  No dead fish or animals were reported.  USCG district 7.

    "description": "NOAA/OMA was notified of the incident on July 31, 1989, by the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, San Juan, and was asked to provide information on environmental resources-at-risk from the spill and on the slick's probable trajectory.  NOAA reported that the shoreline is mostly sand beaches, gravel beaches, mixed sand and gravel beaches, and rocky shores or seawalls.  The offshore islands that are surrounded by mangroves would not be affected if the winds continued to be easterly.  NOAA estimated that the slick would tend to the west or northwest and would come ashore on beaches inshore and to the west of the facility.  This could have occurred for a considerable distance, depending on the weather conditions and local small-scale oceanographic circulation patterns.  There was a small chance that, with a large enough quantity of free-floating, unrestricted oil and continued easterly winds, the oil might round Punta Guayanilla and impact the beaches of Punta Verraco and Bahia de Guayanilla.  If this did happen, NOAA advised that the large mangrove forests of Bahia de Guayanilla be protected.  NOAA further advised that the oil would persist in the environment, with a small quantity evaporating during weathering.  Reef impacts would be low because the oil is not very soluble; there would probably be no impacts at all below the surface, although there could be severe shoreline impacts.   In addition, NOAA reported that the oil would strand at the high tide line and persist or wash away, depending on sand and gravel transport on that beach.  Finally, sticky, weathered bunker oil would adhere to rocky shores and mangroves, killing the mangroves when the oil got into the root system. Turtles currently nesting in Puerto Rico and along the sandy beaches of Punta Verraco were at risk.  Oiled adults would suffer irritated mucous membranes and would develop lesions that would probably result in an increased risk of infection.  Oiled hatchlings would probably die, whether they were on the beach or floating offshore.  Oiled turtle eggs and newly hatched turtles had a greater than 80% chance of mortality.  There were many species of birds present, including the brown pelican, a federally listed endangered species.  If oiled feathers remained untreated, the birds would die as a result of loss of insulation or ingestion of oil during preening.  The diving birds (brown pelican, brown booby, terns), wading birds  (herons and egrets), shorebirds (plovers, sandpipers), and ducks were the most likely to be affected because they would dive and wade into the oil slick.  Seabirds (magnificent frigate bird) and gulls skim the surface when feeding and would also be affected.  Large numbers of gulls would also be impacted.  USCG district 7."

On-site, the NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC) observed two badly corroded barges lying nearly end-to-end, leaking an unknown oily substance into the waters of the channel.  Some boom had been deployed around portions of the barges and numerous vessels of lengths up to 35 feet, in various stages of maintenance or disrepair surrounded the barge hulls.   Because the barges were unattended and threatened by local high water runoff and local vessel traffic, the SSC recommended immediate efforts to double boom and isolate the barges.  Security measures were suggested to prevent tampering and further damage to the barges until the material within could be properly identified, safely removed and isolated for disposal.  \"Core\" samples from each tank and Level B personnel protection were also strongly recommended.  In addition, the SSC recommended that local and state water board, storm levy and canal lock officials be contacted to ensure immediate emergency response should waters from the spill site and Doullut Canal have to be isolated from the Mississippi River and the sensitive areas of Adams Bay and surrounding wetlands.  NOAA further advised the Coast Guard of the presence, year-round, of Eastern oyster in Adams Bay and Bastian Bay downstream, south and west of the site.

Both vessels were damaged, with about 5,700 barrels of heavy \"slurry\" oil spilling from the barge.  The collision occurred at the junction of the Houston and Bay Port Ship channels. The oil moved rapidly westward and diversionary booming operations funnelled an estimated 5,600 barrels of the oil into the west end of the Bay Port Ship Basin by mid-day on June 24.  Vacuum equipment was staged at the southwest margin of the basin; recovery operations and containment of the damaged barge 2514 were begun in the Basin.  The RACHEL B was reported not to be leaking and was allowed to proceed into Houston Harbor for inspection and repairs to her damaged bow and hull.  USCG district 8."

The grounding damaged four of the vessel's cargo tanks, resulting in the release of approximately 7310 barrels of No. 6 Oil into the river.  The weather at the time was cloudy with occasional thunderstorms, variable light winds, 71?F, and 2-3 miles visibility. The owners of the vessel assumed responsibility and hired a contractor to deploy booms around the ship.  Another company was hired as prime contractor for the entire cleanup operation. Cleanup operations began immediately.  By mid-morning of the first day, the vessel had been boomed and lightering operations had commenced.  A Multi Agency Local Response Team (MALRT) meeting was held at noon on the first day at the Marine Safety Office (MSO) Philadelphia.  By the morning of June 25, the vessel had been refloated and moved to the Sun Oil Co. terminal at Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania for final lightering and inspection.  By June 28, there was no significant free-floating oil observed in the river.  The vessel was in dry dock in Philadelphia by July 8.  Cleanup operations continued into the spring of 1990.

    "description": "At 1640 on June 23, 1989, the Greek Tank Ship World Prodigy ran hard aground on Brenton Reef near the entrance to Narragansett Bay, approximately four miles south of Newport, Rhode Island.  The vessel was loaded with 8.2 million gallons (over 195,000 barrels) of No. 2 home heating oil.  The grounding tore a 200-foot gash in the hull of the ship, ruptured 9 of the 23 cargo tanks and released approximately 6,900 barrels of oil into the waters of Rhode Island Sound.  Immediately before the accident, the vessel was observed operating out of the shipping channel, closer to the Brenton Reef than it should have been.  The accident occurred during daylight hours with partly cloudy skies, calm seas, winds NW at 5-10 knots, and visibility 6-8 miles. The response began immediately.  Seven rescue ships and several USCG vessels with boom arrived at the scene of the grounding within eleven minutes.  The USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST) was activated within thirty minutes.  The pre-designated Federal On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) was the Captain of the Port (COTP), Providence, Rhode Island.   The OSC assumed federal responsibility for the spill response within two hours, following the determination that the incident was beyond the control of the ship's captain and the owners, Ballard Shipping of Monrovia, Liberia.  A $50,000 ceiling on the pollution fund was established, which was later raised to $3.4 million.  The OSC immediately hired cleanup contractors and requested boom and other cleanup equipment.  The COTP Providence established a 500 yard safety zone around the grounded vessel. The vessel was surrounded with three layers of containment boom.  The remaining cargo onboard was offloaded into barges beginning June 24.  The area within the boom was cleaned with skimmers beginning on June 26.  The booms remained in place until the vessel was cleared by the OSC to sail on July 2.  The T/S World Prodigy arrived at New York Harbor on July 3.  USCG district 1.

Catahoula Lake, 10 miles long by 3-1/2 miles wide, is about 20 miles northeast of Alexandria, Louisiana.  The lake is one of the State's more significant inland recreational resources and is the site of a national wildlife refuge.  Freshwater commercial fishing, oil production, sportfishing, and wildlife studies are some of the more notable activities associated with the lake. Early on May 25, the slick was estimated at 15-20 barrels by the State, and covered an area measuring 5-1/2 miles long by one mile wide.  The oil was moving toward the Catahoula Wildlife Refuge and Bird Island on the northeast end of the lake.  Lake waters were 12-13 feet above normal due to heavy spring rains and already flooding wading bird nesting areas and vegetation.   Exxon Oil Company, owner/operator of some of the production facilities in the lake, was attempting unsuccessfully to contain the oil.  They also reported that their collection lines had just been pressure-checked and were not leaking any product.  USCG district 8."

The U.S. Department of the Interior Minerals Management Service was concerned that a collapse could shear off well head assemblies on the sea floor 200 feet below the rig, spilling up to 200 barrels of crude oil daily.  Oil seepage was occurring at the head assemblies but shut-in of the wells was not possible because of the March 20 fire damage to casing and valves.  In addition, ARCO officials were reluctant to attempt capping the three wells below the platform because the gas line used to drive the wells was unsafe as a result of the fire and explosion in March. Heavy weather on scene had thus far hindered divers' attempts to close off the gas line.  USCG district 8."

The vessel was traveling outside normal shipping lanes in an attempt to avoid ice.  Within six hours of the grounding, the Exxon Valdez spilled approximately 10.9 million gallons of its 53 million gallon cargo of Prudhoe Bay Crude.  Eight of the eleven tanks on board were damaged.  The oil would eventually impact over 1,100 miles of non-continuous coastline in Alaska, making the Exxon Valdez the largest oil spill to date in U.S. waters. The response to the Exxon Valdez involved more personnel and equipment over a longer period of time than did any other spill in U.S. history.  Logistical problems in providing fuel, meals, berthing, response equipment, waste management and other resources were one of the largest challenges to response management.  At the height of the response, more than 11,000 personnel, 1,400 vessels and 85 aircraft were involved in the cleanup. Shoreline cleanup began in April of 1989 and continued until September of 1989 for the first year of the response.  The response effort continued in 1990 and 1991 with cleanup in the summer months, and limited shoreline monitoring in the winter months.

Efforts to stop the fuel leak and contain the spill began shortly thereafter.  Cool temperatures and rainy weather hampered containment and cleanup, and the oil began disappearing below the surface of the canal.   Cleanup operations were discontinued a week later when approximately 150 barrels of the material had been recovered from a six-mile section of the waterway.  However, during the next few days, daytime temperatures increased with clearing skies and the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO), Morgan City, was inundated with spill reports from up and down the Intracoastal Waterway near Houma.

    "description": "NOAA /OMA was notified of the incident at approximately 1430 on February 4, 1989 by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, San Francisco, and requested to advise on the toxicity of the products involved and safety considerations, and to recommend a strategy to mitigate the impacts of the release.  Dimethoate is a sulfur-containing compound with a mercaptin-like odor.  Its high molecular weight and low vapor pressure makes it quite stable in solid form at ambient temperatures, and its odor is noticeable even in extremely low concentrations.  NOAA hypothesized that some vapor from the solid dimethoate may have leaked into the closed container during shipment, and that it was this vapor that was detected while the vessel was en route to San Francisco.  The concentration in the atmosphere within the container was probably never at a toxic level even though it would have been uncomfortable to breathe.  Once the container was opened and exposed to circulating air, the detectable odor would dissipate rapidly.    NOAA recommended that personnel involved in the inspection of the shipping container be suited in Level B protection as a conservative measure as dimethoate does not present a significant inhalation hazard when shipped in solid form.  The primary concern with this product was to avoid inhalation or ingestion of airborne dust from a potentially damaged shipping container and to restrict dermal contact to minimize any chance of skin absorption.  A visual inspection of the container by the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office found no evidence of damage to the container or spillage of dimethoate.  Accordingly, the container was left aboard the vessel for continuation to the WAARDRECHT's destination in Mexico.   The case was closed after the container was inspected and found to be undamaged.

    "description": "On December 26, 1988, the United Marine Tug and Barge, Inc. (UMTB) Tank Barge 283, towed by the tug Marine Explorer, began sinking stern down approximately 35 miles southeast of Simeonof Island, on the western side of the Gulf of Alaska.  The tug and barge, en route to Dutch Harbor with approximately 47,620 barrels of diesel on board, encountered extremely rough weather.  The pump room and starboard aft tanks, which had been empty, were now flooded, causing the barge to turn bow-up with approximately 80 feet of the barge above water and the remaining 200 feet below the surface.  The tug's crew members observed oil coming from the vicinity of the waste oil tanks in the stern area.  Although the barge owner speculated that the stern anchor had punctured the aft waste oil tank, the exact cause of the sinking was never determined.  The salvage vessel M/V Salvage Chief  hired by Seattle-based UMTB arrived on January 7 after an eight-day passage from Astoria, Oregon.  Meanwhile, the barge continued leaking diesel fuel as 50-60 knot winds and 20-25 foot seas pounded the area. The tug Salvage Chief arrived on-scene January 7 with divers and a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to investigate the bottom of the barge.  Small cracks found in the port and starboard main decks were sealed with wooden plugs.\\\\After considering all the options, UMTB asked the USCG for assistance in sinking the barge.  The barge was sunk by the USCG Cutter Sedge  at 1246 on January 13, 1989, approximately 11 miles southwest of the Semidi Islands at 55 48 N and 156 46 W.\\\\Due to the location of the spill, on-scene weather conditions, and the rate of oil leakage, no cleanup action was performed. By January 4, only 40 feet of the barge's bow remained above the surface.  From the attitude of the barge, the owner's naval architects and salvage master speculated that four tanks remained filled with diesel fuel while the other tank's cargo was displaced by water. Initially, the owner requested resource agency clearance to move the barge to Stepovak Bay for lightering and repair operations.  As the barge, with the tug and tow line still attached, drifted northeast parallel to the coast, evaluations of Stepovak, Castle, Devil's, and Kuiukta bays, along the southeastern side of the Alaska Peninsula, were requested of NOAA.  The upright-floating barge was extremely difficult to tow.  The vessels were caught in a clockwise back-eddy off of the southwesterly flowing Alaska stream which carried them towards the northeast. The weather remained severe (Beaufort Force 9 with icy conditions) throughout the entire incident.  Even though the tug Marine Explorer remained attached to the barge, it was virtually impossible for it to influence their naturally drifting motion and trajectory.  On January 11, 1989, the owners requested USCG assistance in sinking the barge.  On January 13, the USCG Cutter Sedge  used 1500 rounds of 20 mm fire to sink Barge 283 in approximately 102 fathoms of water.  The case was closed on January 18, 1989.  USCG district 17.

NOAA advised that potential health and/or environmental impacts should be reported to local and state health officials and to state environmental officials.  Mr. Winkler reported that he had made a number of these reports to State and County officials but was not satisfied with their response.  After the first call, NOAA looked at the thermal images of the Gulf Stream and discussed with Mr. Winkler that Gulf Steam waters or material dumped in New York City would not be in direct contact with Bethany Bay beaches.  NOAA also contacted marine laboratories and phytoplankton experts at the University of Delaware, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Laboratories at Mountlake, WA, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  The names and contact numbers for phytoplankton experts at these institutions were provided to Mr. Winkler.   NOAA coordinated with the State of Delaware's environmental officials on each of the \"red tide\" reports that we received and with our efforts in contacting expert laboratories to determine the results of Mr. Winkler's samples.  On September 15th the Delaware's Director of Water Resources wrote a 4-page letter to Mr. Winkler listing the considerable efforts of the State of Delaware's Department of Water Resources to investigate each of Mr. Winkler's reports.  Delaware's letter noted that samples analyzed by DNREC \"reveal no Pfieseria, no significant water chemistry findings, and no presence of organisms in bloom-like conditions\" and that the \"water samples collected by you (Mr. Winkler) and DNREC that have been analyzed by the Florida Marine Research Institute and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute have revealed no harmful species, no toxic dinoflagellate species, and no red tide cell concentrations.\" On September 22ed the NOAA SSC discussed Mr. Winkler's reports with the Chief of the Bethany Beach Fire Company and a member of the Bethany Beach Town Council.  Both the Fire Chief and the member of the Town Council reported that there were no unusual health impact reports from swimmers using the city's beaches.    On September 29th the laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington reported to DNREC that they were able to detect numbers of plankton specie named \"Chattonella verruculosa\" in the samples of water that were provided to them by Mr. Winkler.   This plankton had previously been reported in waters as far north as North Carolina, but experts at the University of North Carolina reported that it was unusual for this species to be as far north as Delaware.  This plankton did produce a brevetoxin  On October 12th the State of Delaware organized a seminar to discuss the complexity of the algal booms and their potential toxicity in Mid Atlantic Ocean waters.  As a result of Delaware's efforts, scientists from Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina are sharing information on the algal booms reported off their coasts.  It seems clear to these scientists that much of the \"reds stuff in the water\" sightings reported during the summer of 2000 were algal booms.  The scientists reported that it is not unusual for these blooms to drift with the currents and appear or disappear from one day to the next (or even hour to hour.)  The \"disappearing\" of the bloom is likely due to wind and other weather conditions.  For example, when it is windy, the bloom, that is often concentrated near the surface, can be mixed down several feet and thus become almost invisible.  If the wind subsides and the sun conditions are right, these organisms can float or swim back to the surface and again become much more visible.  USCG district 7."

    "description": "On June 22, 1988, oil spill was observed in the water around the Pickworth Dock at the city dock complex.  The U.S. Coast Guard was unable to locate a responsible party, and estimated that 200-300 gallons of a refined product (diesel or kerosene) was in the water.  Since a small, roughly 50-gallon pool of the product was isolated and confined, the Coast Guard sought to use this as a spill-of-opportunity to use Elastol, a product that increases the visco-elasticity of oil in order to make it easier to pick up with a skimmer or vacuum truck.

The fire was initially contained by the Springfield Fire Department, using only dry chemicals because the chemicals stored at the facility would react with water to produce considerable heat, releasing chlorine and other toxic fumes. At about midnight on the same day, a second fire broke out when the materials on site reacted with rainwater entering through damaged windows.  The fire also set off the sprinkler system which added more water, escalating the chemical reaction.  The old brick, stone, and wood timber mill facility that contained Advanced Laboratories was destroyed.  The fire and chemical reactions also produced a moving and often invisible plume of wood smoke, choking chlorine, and other toxic gases that enveloped the fire scene and the surrounding area. Late on June 18, the fire increased in intensity with chemical containers occasionally exploding or otherwise reacting with water and/or the surrounding fire to produce large quantities of additional heat, chlorine, and other combustion gases.  At approximately 1800 on June 18, the Springfield Fire Department elected to deluge the fire scene with huge quantities of water.  The plume of chlorine and other combustion and reaction gases extended downwind for several miles in a north by northeast direction.  USCG district 1."

NOAA was also asked to advise on the environmental resources-at-risk if the vessel was allowed to sink.     The NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator advised the Coast Guard that sinking the vessel could produce two scenario extremes.  The most likely scenario would be a small, continuous leak from the tank's vent pipes.  However, a catastrophic release of the entire fuel tank could occur any time during or after the sinking of the vessel.  Since the vessel was subject to the Tongass Narrows currents,  the visible extent of the slick and sheen could range from a few meters in length to a few thousand meters, respectively.      NOAA suggested that the Coast Guard check the water depth at the pier because a partial sinking could result in a tidally induced pumping action which would cause a much greater rate of outflow of diesel fuel.    Consultation with resource agencies revealed large populations of herring and chinook salmon, and thousands of seabirds, including 50 bald eagles, in the vessel's immediate vicinity.  Any of these animals could be affected by a release.  USCG district 17."

At this time, Gardinier indicated that a spill had occurred over the weekend but was contained on-site. On May 3, Gardinier called the county to indicate that a large fish kill had occurred in the mouth of the Alafia River and that some of the spilled acid may have entered the river. The Coast Guard learned of the spill from media reports on May 4 and confirmed the information with the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation. It was later learned that approximately 336 tons of PFS fertilizing solution (75% phosphoric acid) had entered the river over the weekend.  This was out of a total of 3,937 tons spilled during transfer procedures on April 30.  The acid sank to the bottom of the turning basin at the mouth of the river, then migrated upriver and out  along the bottom of the dredged channel into Hillsborough Bay with the tides. On May 3 lowered pH values were detected from approximately one mile out the channel into the bay upriver 4.5 miles to the Route 301 bridge.  USCG district 7."

On April 6, the NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC) visited the MacLouth site with Coast Guard COTP Detroit investigators.  Observations included a continuous discharge from the clarifier outfall and residual oil along shoreline as far as one-half mile downriver.   A second visit by boat was made on April 13.  The discharge was continuous throughout this visit as well.  Nonimpacted shoreline above the discharge and bottom samples from the nearshore area further delineated the extent of contamination.   Calculations of the impact suggest a volume of between 100 and 1,000 gallons of residual petroleum along the shoreline.  This volume of petroleum would likely dissipate in a matter of weeks once the release was discontinued.  The surrounding area along the Detroit River was also considered in making the recommendation.  NOAA recommended that, once discharge was controlled, the shoreline should be evaluated to ensure that residual petroleum does not persist beyond the expected period.  USCG district 9."

Investigation revealed that a garage bay was being used as a sump for waste oil from the buses maintained at the Vanguard Bus Company.  Three paths were identified by which the waste oil was being discharged from the collection bay, in the garage.  Two pipes lead directly to a creek adjacent to the facility which runs into the Hudson River.  The third path was a pipe which ran toward the River and ended in an underground gravel field.   The Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP) New York, instructed the responsible party to immediately secure the pipes to the river.  The pipe which drained directly into the gravel field was not of immediate concern to the Coast Guard.  The State of New York and County of Westchester regulate the land release of oil.  A meeting was arranged at which the various governmental agencies and the responsible party would discuss concerns and review planned actions.  USCG district 1."

    "description": "On October 10, 1987, the YUM II, a Mexican exploratory oil well located approximately 20 miles northwest of Ciudad del Carmen in the Bay of Campeche under the Zapoteca rig, experienced a blowout and fire.  Apparently, a blowout preventer (BOP) valve malfunction caused the initial blowout.  Although the BOP had successfully shut the annulus between the drill pipe and well casing, the blind rams failed to shear through the drill pipe that was still in the well casing.  Therefore, oil and gas flowed out of the well, up the drill pipe, and onto the platform where it ignited.  The oil discharge increased after the escaping gas and oil forced the drill pipe out of the well.  The initial fire was extinguished by October 17.  As of October 28, the well was still spewing out a yellow gas/crude mix  60-100 feet in the air.  The owners of the well, Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), and the Mexican Navy participated in cleanup operations.  The well was finally \"killed\" on November 30.   Even though the incident site was 600 miles from Texas, the slick could have traveled in a northerly direction to reach United States waters depending on the duration of the spill.  Accordingly, the USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) at Corpus Christi, Texas, was notified of the incident on October 13.  Verification and correct information were not received until October 16.  Even though USCG assistance was refused, the USCG conducted overflights of the area every other day until the well was capped to track the spill response and the movement of the oil.  Reports of cleanup activities from the Mexican authorities were infrequent and largely erroneous.  Daily reports from the Mexican Embassy to USCG Headquarters in Washington, D.C. were not available when promised.  USCG district 8.

Approximately 27,000 gallons of product have been recovered to date.  Since 1985, NOAA has provided scientific support on this incident to the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO) in Baltimore.

    "description": "On September 21, 1987 at 0600, the Liberian bulk carrier Pac Baroness and the Panamanian freighter Atlantic Wing collided in foggy, high sea conditions, twelve miles southwest of Point Conception, California.  The Pac Baroness was carrying 21,000 metric tons of dry bulk copper concentrate consisting of 30% copper, 30% iron, 30% other oxides and approximately 9,200 barrels of bunker fuel (IFO-180 and marine diesel fuel) as well as quantities of  lube oil and hydraulic oil. The Atlantic Wing was carrying automobiles and was bound for Long Beach. The Pac Baroness sustained damage to the number 4 and 5 cargo holds and the Atlantic Wing suffered a 25 foot by 10 foot gash in her bow.  The Chief Engineer on board the Pac Baroness activated the vessel's bilge pumps and a tug attached a towline to the vessel to prevent the Pac Baroness from drifting toward the shoreline.  By 1607, the Pac Baroness was still  taking on water and was  close to sinking.  The Pac Baroness sank at 1618 on September 21, resulting in a release of approximately 9,200 barrels of oil and quantities of copper ore over the next 20 days.  The currents at the time of the incident were to the northwest at 3-4 knots; winds in the area were from the N-NW at 10 knots.  The seasonal Davidson Current flows north along isobaths at about 0.25 knots. The Clean Seas Co-op was originally conducting cleanup on behalf of the owners of the Pac Baroness.  On September 24, Clean Seas notified the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) Federal On Scene Coordinator (FOSC) that they would no longer be continuing operations due to disagreements over their contract with the owners.  The FOSC declared the incident a Federal response and opened the 311 (k) fund.  The USCG began negotiations to contract Clean Seas as part of the Federal response.  By September 28, Clean Seas had resumed working for the owners of the Pac Baroness, with the agreement that the owners would finance the Clean Seas response inclusive of the period from September 24 to September 28.

NOAA confirmed that the material was, in fact, zinc dust, a residue of Aerovox's zinc plating operation.  NOAA concurred with the Chemical Transportation Emergency Center's (CHEMTREC) recommendation that a dry chemical extinguishing agent be used.  The New Bedford Fire Department had approximately 200 pounds of a dry chemical fire extinguisher, Metal X, on hand.  NOAA/OAD's backup recommendation ( if the dry chemical fire extinguisher did not work) was to flood the hopper bin with very large quantities of water.  The New Bedford Fire Department used the Metal X fire extinguisher and large quantities of Fuller's Earth.  NOAA now advised that large quantities of water would be an unsuitable backup plan under these conditions, because any quantity of water might no be able to get through the dry chemical and Fuller's earth barrier to adequately cool the burning zinc.  Under these conditions, hydrogen gas might be released, ultimately creating an explosive atmosphere.  USCG district 1."

Because of the noxious fumes and penetrating odor of the spilled material, the California Highway Patrol cordoned off a ten-block radius around the spill.  Within two hours, 500 people were evacuated from residences around the area.  Approximately 30 more people received medical attention at a local hospital.

NOAA transmitted physical and chemical properties on each of the spilled chemicals to the Coast Guard MSO.  Specifically, NOAA indicated that most of the methylene chloride should have evaporated away due to its high vapor pressure.  Phenol has a lower vapor pressure and is soluble in water and could present a skin contact problem.  The metals could be highly hazardous if in a dust form and inhaled.  However, since the metals were most likely in a salt form and tied up in the sediment, they did not present a respiratory hazard.  Since metals could get in the food chain and bioconcentrate, contaminated sediment should be removed.  USCG district 7."

Consultation with the NWS in Anchorage indicated quite variable wind and weather conditions, thus making fuel trajectory forecasts difficult and unreliable.  By March 12, the salvage crew, Underwater Construction, reported that the vessel had been abandoned, with the crew to arrive in Adak on March 13, and 70% of the 18,000 gallon fuel capacity had been lost.  A U.S. Coast Guard overflight on March 13 reported that the vessel remained hard aground on a rocky ledge 100-200 yards off the beach with a 15 degree starboard list, and a light oil sheen up to 3/4 mile long observed.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) reported that, by mid-April, an estimate 500 sea otters and 7,000 birds (gulls, cormorants, and puffins) would be in the area.  USFWS recommended three possible courses of action to remove the oil: 1) removing the fuel, 2) burning the fuel in place, or 3) during a favorable wind, blow the tanks and release all the fuel at once.

Early reports from the ship's master indicated that currents and wind had pushed the 510 foot car carrier into the jetty.  Tugs pulled the Fern Passat off the jetty before midnight. The Coast Guard On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) ordered the vessel to anchor outside of the sea buoy to minimize the effect of oil onshore, given the forecasted strong easterly winds.  The ship was ordered in subsequent days to anchor 34 and 54 miles offshore to further minimize the chances of more oil coming ashore.  This placed the ship in the Gulf Stream current which would carry the oil north.  USCG district 7."

On the reversing tidal current, the diesel was carried directly over fish subsistence clam beds just offshore from Hydaburg.  The clam beds are the source of cockles, butter, horse, double-neck and razor clams.  Eventually, the current carried a sheen 6-7 miles southeast into Hetta Inlet.

    "description": "The failure of a 600,000 gallon tank at the Rollins terminal in Bayonne, New Jersey, resulted in a spill of approximately 450,000 gallons of caustic soda into the Kill Van Kull, which separates Bayonne from Staten Island, New York.  The leak was reported by Rollins to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), New York on January 19, 1987. The local fire department was the first responder and aided the facility in diking the released caustic, thereby preventing additional caustic from reaching the Kill.  The Coast Guard COTP and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  (DEP) advised the facility on appropriate methods to reduce effects to the environment and ensure compliance with environmental laws. A brown, milky plume was observed along the shore of the Kill and out approximately 100 feet before it dissipated.  Testing of pH with litmus paper revealed the pollutant to be of a pH greater than 14 along the shore, where it entered the water.  USCG district 3."

Initially, the Dutch Harbor Fire Department and the tug Padilla attempted to extinguish the fire.  In response to a reported ammonia leak, the Coast Guard Federal On-Scene Coordinator established a 1,000 yard safety zone around the OSI dock where the Great Alaskan was moored.  At 1400 on December 22, the Coast Guard in Anchorage was advised by on-scene personnel that the fire was extinguished and smoldering.  However, the fire reflashed one hour later and burned out of control.  This time, the fire department allowed the vessel to burn rather than hazard personnel.  at 1510, a major explosion occurred, resulting in a six by eight foot hole in the vessel's side above the waterline.

The ammonium nitrate reacts explosively with fuel.  There is concern that the fuel may enter #4 hold if the ship continues to work on the reef.  The Coast Guard asked if the ammonium nitrate could be off-loaded into deep water with out adverse environmental effect.  Conference call was held with CMD MacDonald in Guam (011-617-339-4107), HMRB Seattle, and Ed Overton. . MacDonald was advised of chemical reaction problems.  Ed said that nitrate could be off-loaded without adverse effects in unconfined waters.  Suggested flooding #4 if diesel began leaking into hold. This would dilute nitrate, diesel would float on top, preventing mixing.  Water flow into the tank should be maintained to keep concentration of nitrate down. . Weather on scene presently winds from the west.  Conditions may worsen due to tropical depression forming in the area.  MASS is contacting the weather service for latest information. .

Two days after the initial gas leak from the drilling pad, gas was observed emerging through the ground in several locations within a one-half mile radius of the pad, including into the Swanson River.  On December 15 the leaking gas got into an oil-bearing strata and expelled approximately five barrels of oil onto the surface of the drilling pad through the leaking well.  Due to the number of gas fumaroles, a major concern was discharge of more oil, particularly into the Swanson River.

    "description": "On Thursday, November 27, the U.S. Navy Base at Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico discovered a spill of JP-5 in Ensenada Honda Bay (NOAA chart 25666).  The source of the leak was traced back to a tank which held 907,000 gal. of JP-5. The tank (#85) was discovered leaking fuel out of an old flange.  Workman had just completed installing a new tank bottom by installing it several feet above the old bottom. In between the two bottoms was filled with sand. The tank passed a standard vacuum test and then was filled with fuel on Wednesday.  Best guess is that the leak began late Wednesday night or early Thursday.  Fuel was found pouring out of the flange to the old tank bottom on Thursday morning. Apparently the new tank bottom leaked allowing fuel to flow down to the old bottom.  A shut off valve to the old tank bottom was in an open position which allowed the fuel to pour out onto the ground. The tank is located approximately 1/4  mile from the bay. The fuel filled a depression in the ground and then overflowed into an area which contained a drainage pipe.  The fuel flowed down this  drainage pipe directly into the bay.  USCG district 7."

    "description": "On August 22, 1986, U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO), Toledo, personnel discovered a large rainbow sheen flowing into the Maumee River from the Swan Creek entrance.  Subsequent investigation showed the sheen to be originating from the creek bank approximately 1500 yards upstream adjacent to property owned by Plabell Rubber Products, Inc.  The creek bank was found to be saturated with oil which was leaching into the creek.  Fifty feet directly up the creek bank on Plabell property were fill pipes for two 1000 gallon underground storage tanks used by the company.  The tanks contained a \"chemically neutralized heavy napthenic distillate,\" product name CIRCO LIGHT RPO (Sun Refining and Marketing). Oil samples were taken from the tanks, water, and soil, and sent to the City of Toledo Environmental Services Agency and the Coast Guard Central Oil Identification Laboratory (COIL) in Groton, Connecticut, for analysis.  The Coast Guard MSO, Toledo, also deployed a sorbent boom to contain the oil. Results of the COIL lab testing indicated that samples from the tanks and water were very similar, but contained differences that could not be attributed to weathering or contamination alone.  The president of Plabell Rubber declined responsibility based on these differences between the tank and pollutant samples. On November 17, another large rainbow sheen was found on the Maumee emanating from Swan Creek.  Plabell Rubber Products was again found to be the source, when a sorbent boom placed by the company was found to be ineffective.  USCG district 9."

Winds were from the south at 10-12 knots, moving the acrylonitrile vapors and burn products away from the American Cyanamid plant and across the river toward East Bank of Kenner.  NOAA's air plume model indicated that, under a worst  case situation, given the existing weather, that the potentially toxic smoke plume would not cross the river with a concentration greater than 20 parts per million (ppm).  In a similar incident, this concentration of 20 ppm acrylonitrile had been established by the National Institute of Health Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as a reasonable lower limit for evacuation planning.  Since this concentration was not predicted to reach the populated portions of the East Bank, no evacuation was recommended.  USCG district 8."

    "description": "On July 27, 1986, a coupling for a Pennwalt Corporation pipeline pulled apart, causing 5,000 gallons of sulfuric acid to spill directly into the Hylebos Waterway in Tacoma, Washington.The acid quickly diluted in the waterway and residual was cleaned up by Pennwalt.  There was no aquatic mortality.NOAA/OAD was notified of the incident on July 28, 1986, by the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in Seattle, and requested to assess the potential problems that might be associated with the spill.  NOAA advised that the sulfuric acid would rapidly dilute to a safe level in a localized area (200 yards).  However, fumes from the reaction of sulfuric acid with water might be present in the immediate area.   NOAA also cautioned the Coast Guard that there would be a possibility of  a localized fish kill.  USCG district 13."

Worzonoff in Upper Cook Inlet.  The pressure drop was interpreted as a leak in the cable dielectric fluid, dodecylbenzene (DD), which is maintained at a positive pressure to prevent any salt water intrusion into the  cable.  The subsequent release of DDB into the marine environment was calculated by Chugach to be 5-10 gallons per day.  As a result, on June 2, 1986, Chugach voluntarily de-energized and depressurized its cable, reducing fluid loss to 1-2 gallons per day and commenced an inspection program.  On June 4, 1986, the  U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO), Anchorage, and the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) were notified of the situation.  USCG district 17."

The plant had a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, which requires routine composite sampling of discharge water each month; coincidentally, the monthly sampling occurred within 24 hours of the accidental release.  Sample results indicated contamination levels of 19.75 ppm, significantly higher than the permit discharge level for both chemicals in composite samples of 9 ppm.

The crew of the small boat had great difficulty locating the slick, although a commercial aircraft flying overhead confirmed that they were in the locale of the reported slick.  The boat crew reported that the material was lightly concentrated, with only small patches of the product observable.  The boat crew took a sample of the material, which had accumulated on the side of their boat.  USCG district 5."

The floor of the diked containment area was breached by several large diameter monitoring wells previously installed to remove petroleum products from the groundwater.  The sodium hydroxide, owned by the Dow Chemical Company under a service agreement with Contract Oil for receiving, storing, and delivering the product, ran from the broken pipe into one of the monitoring wells, and flowed via another pipe directly into the Marquette Harbor basin 30 feet away.  In less than 48 hours, virtually all of the sodium hydroxide had flowed into the harbor basin and spread out over the bottom under the ice, leaving less than 15,000 gallons within the diked area.  Upon notification of the release, the Dow Chemical Emergency Response Team undertook a cleanup of contaminated soils in the diked area.  USCG district 9."

At approx 1100 hours the leak was reported to have been stopped.  Total time of the leak was reported to be 50 minutes. . NOAA RESPONSE . Based upon the above information, the spill would have occured near slack water and not moved much upstream. . The downsteam excursion would be estimated at 5 miles for this tidal cycle. . Winds reported from the NW would tend to move the floating crude oil onto the New Jersey shore in the Penns Grove areas. . Recommend that Oldmans Creek receive priority attention for booming. . After the tide changes, Raccon Creek should receive booming attention. . Deflection booming or stnadby booming for the Christina River should be made available if overflight observations indicate enough oil has escaped Sun Oil's efforts at booming the spill at the source. . Future planning for boom deployment downriver in the Salem River areas should be considered.  These expensive actions would depend on observations made both today March 21st and tomorrow March 22.

Kennedy, ran aground on the Grand Chain Rocks at Upper Mississippi river mile 43.4 while en route to Garyville, Louisiana.  The tow consisted of eight barges, all loaded with western crude oil.  Texas  and Kansas  were the two barges at the front of the tow which included six other barges.  The grounding occurred shortly after the pilot had navigated to clear the Thebes Railroad Bridge.  While the Kansas  appeared undamaged, the Texas  sustained heavy damage to the bottom of its number 1-6 starboard and 1-3 port cargo tanks.  USCG Group Upper Mississippi River was notified of the incident at 0308. Early attempts to rig boom around the damaged barge failed due to rapid currents and river conditions.  Ingram Barge Company of Nashville, Tennessee, the owner/operator of the M/V Edwin L. Kennedy  and the Texas, hired Paducah Mutual Assistance Association (PMAA) as the primary cleanup contractor.  The owner representative also participated in overflights to provide a better summary of the situation.  Lightering operations of the Kansas  began at 1400.  By 0800, March 8, this barge floated free with no apparent damage.  Lightering of the Texas  began on March 8.  At 1420, March 9, the barge was free and repositioned at mile 43.4 left descending bank.  By 1615, the barge was drafting approximately five feet after ballasting.  No evidence of further pollution was noted. After a Permit to Proceed was issued to the Texas, the barge was allowed to continue on to New Orleans for offloading and repairs.  Simpson Environmental Services of Port Natchez, Texas, was brought in as a second cleanup contractor.  Soundings taken on March 12 revealed 17,055 barrels of oil were missing from the Texas.  Cleanup operations were completed by March 28.  USCG district 9.  Keyword: Boom, sorbents.."

A survey  by the Coast Guard of the adjoining shorelines failed to find a potential source for the spill, or evidence of additional pollution outside of the immediate area of the Coast Guard pier.  A contractor was hired, and cleanup commenced at 0930.  Another shoreline survey, conducted on March 4 at low tide, revealed that the contaminated area now extended from the Coast Guard Support Center north to the Charles River Locks.  The oil was confined to the southern side of the harbor and appeared to be leaching from a section of the seawall beneath the Charlestown Bridge.  Cleanup activities were expanded to  include the newly discovered impacted shoreline.  The Coast Guard continued its attempts to identify the source.  USCG district 1."

Initial symptoms were burning of the eyes, coughing, and throat irritation.  Length of exposure was about 20-30 minutes, at which time the petty officer in charge of the station ordered all personnel inside the station.  The only clue to the source of the gas was a medium brown haze hanging over the Down Chemical Company facility located about 1/4 miles from the Coast Guard station.  Wind was reported to be blowing from the Dow plant toward the Coast Guard Station, Dow was contacted  by the Coast Guard, Houston, with an inquiry into the possible exposure.  Dow had no record of a release, but sent a representative to interview the exposed personnel.  By about 1030 the victims began experiencing chest and stomach pains, vomiting and general lassitude.

The explosion damaged other tanks and plumbing in the immediate area and spilled the following chemicals:  319,600 gallons of paradichlorobenzene at approximately 95% purity, 53,968 gallons of trichlorobenzene with some paradichlorobenzene;  81,134 gallons of trichlorobenzene with some paradichlorobenzene; and 108,234 gallons of paradichlorobenzene.  The mixtures of trichlorobenzene are reported to be composed of approximately 70% 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene and 20% 1,2,3 trichlorobenzene. The initial wave of paradichlorobenzene was approximately 180 degrees F and flowed east onto the Standard Chlorine facility.  This wave, and the following waves of trichlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, flowed north along railroad tracks and down a draw that feeds an unnamed tributary creek to Red Lion Creek.  The paradichlorobenzene mixture solidified, forming a crust several centimeters thick along the bottom and sides of the tributary, and spread into the floodplain and tidal marsh at the mouth of the creek.  A liquid component (reportedly trichlorobenzene) sank into the stream and oscillated along the stream bed.  Solid chemical material was reported under the water on the bottom of the south shore of Red Lion Creek at the mouth of the creek.  USCG district 3."

Weather conditions were poor, with heavy rain, easterly winds at 25 knots, and 5-6 foot seas.  The master of the Norseman reversed course and headed back into Long Island Sound. The Coast Guard, fearing a catastrophic loss of the barge and the release of the cargo of no. 6 fuel oil into the environmentally sensitive Long Island Sound, ordered the master to come about and head towards open water.  It was thought that towing against the seas and current would stabilize the E-24 and reduce its chance of sinking.  USCG district 3."

The vessel was carrying 814,000 barrels of Alaska North Slope Crude Oil en route from Valdez, Alaska to the Cherry Point Refinery in Bellingham, Washington.  Weather conditions at the time of the incident were calm with a visibility of 3 miles.  The vessel was holed in two cargo tanks resulting in the loss of 5690 barrels of oil into Port Angeles Harbor.  Internal transfer of cargo from the holed tanks stopped the discharge of oil into the water by 2052, December 21.  The ARCO Anchorage remained aground until 0244, December 22 when it was refloated and moved to deeper anchorage within Port Angeles Harbor. Through discussions with the Canadian Coast Guard it was decided that invocation of the joint U.S.  Canadian response plan (CANUSPAC) was not necessary, but that close contact would be maintained.  An ARCO spill response team was activated from Long Beach, California.  Under the influence of wind and tides, the oil was carried to the west almost to Neah Bay and to the east to Dungeness Spit.  No impacts were observed in Canada from this incident.  Cleanup activities were suspended on April 7, 1986.  USCG district 13.

The chemicals included a mixture of tert-butyl alcohol, isobutylene dimer, and small concentrations of ammonia and phenol.  The mixture, used in a manufacturing process at the plant, is normally sent to an on-site BIOX water treatment plant but, due to the pump failure, was mixed with cooling water and discharged into the river.  The diluted liquid had a total organic carbon concentration of less than 1,000 parts per million (ppm).  At 1800 on December 19, an additional release of 10,000 gallons of the mixture occurred over a one-hour period.  USCG district 9."

    "description": "At approximately 1640 on December 15, 1985, the tugboat R & L broke its towline to the cement barge Robert Koch while underway on Lake Ontario outside of Oswego, New York.  The barge was immediately anchored and the personnel on board removed.  At approximately 2245 that evening, the barge, which contained 15 metric tons of Portland cement, an estimated 40 long tons of no. 2 fuel and 600 gallons of lub oil, dragged its anchor and grounded in 15 feet of water one mile east of East Breakwater Light near Oswego. An initial survey found the engine room and all ballast tanks to be flooded.  The single bunker tank was intact, not integral with the hull, and in no immediate danger of rupture.  The cargo hold containing the cement was also intact.  Weather conditions were severe and continued to worsen.  The U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, Buffalo, was notified of the grounding the Coast Guard Station in Oswego on the afternoon of December 16.  USCG district 9."

The incident took place in an area known as \"The Race\", the passage between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, which typically has severe rip tides and rough, unpredictable seas.  On November 23 at 2250 the barge sank in a keel-up position in 185 feet of water.  Approximately 15-24 barrels of Number 6 fuel oil was forced from compartment vents, and as much as 47 barrels of diesel fuel was lost from the pump room. The cargo compartments were not damaged during the sinking. Oil from the barge formed a slick measuring 0.5 miles long by 500 yards wide as observed on November 23.  Cleanup of the Long Island shoreline began on November 24 and was completed by December 5. Approximately 1000 gallons of oily debris were recovered.  Later releases of oil occurred during the salvage operations, but skimming equipment was on station and recovered most of that lost oil immediately.  An estimated 225 birds were affected by the spill, with 75 of these recovered dead. Salvage of the barge without damaging the intact cargo compartments was the major concern.  Due to heavy seas and limitations of equipment on scene, the exact position of the barge could not be determined and verified until December 19.  On January 3, 1986, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) federalized the case as the responsible party, Eklof Transportation Co., Inc. was unable to meet the deadlines imposed by the OSC for performing the hull survey and inspection. Evaluation, planning, and mobilization for the salvage operations took place from January 3 to May 4, 1986.  The salvage plan was developed by the United States Navy Supervisor of Salvage (NAVSUPSALV) at the request of the OSC.  The OSC staff report was completed on March 3, and detailed three salvage options determined by the NAVSUPSALV.  After much deliberation, the OSC determined that the barge should be raised with its cargo intact.  Salvage operations took place from May 5 to May 30, 1986.  Approximately 235 gallons of oil were lost during the entire operation, of which 185 were recovered. The barge was inspected and in tow by the evening of May 29, and was moored at Mariners Harbor, Staten Island, New York by 1900, May 30.  The E-24 was completely offloaded by June 11, 1986, and the case was closed.  USCG district 1.

The vessel's momentum carried it off the shoal.  It anchored nearby, where it was reported to be taking on water and releasing oil.  A survey determined that damage was confined to the no. 3 central fuel tank and consisted of a 20-foot long by two-foot wide gash starboard of the keel.  The no. 3 central tank was sounded and found to contain 17,000 gallons of water and 15,000 gallons of No. 4 fuel oil.  Forty-five minutes after the spill, observers on a U.S. Coast Guard overflight reported a slick measuring 1,000 yards by 500 yards emanating from the vessel.  USCG district 0."

Tomorrow winds will again be light, 5-15kts, with a generally southerly direction. Oil landfall is difficult to predict and is very dependent on what the wind does tomorrow. The oil in Dyes and Sinclair Inlet will tend to mill around with no dominate direction. Oil near rich Passage will be drawn into the Sound on the ebb tide. the next ebb will peak at about 1800. Oil in Port Orchard will tend to move north if the winds are as predicted. In general the threat area can be taken as Port Orchard to Waterman Pt., the north side of Rich Passage, the west side of Bainbridge Island, and the northern end of Dyes Inlet. It is not possible to pridict how oil leaving Rich Passage on an ebb will move  in the Sound. Clam Bay is at some risk.  Sensitive Environmental Resources There are a number of very sensitive sheltered tidal flats and marshes(ESI 9-10) in Sinclair and Dyes Inlets. Subject to the trajectory information above, these should be a high priority for protection.  Sinclair INlet southwest end Dyes Inlet Silverdale Madrona Pt. Mud Bay Phinney Bay Chico Bay  There are a wide variety of shore, wading, and diving birds and waterfowl in the Inlets, Port Orchard, and especially Clam Bay. River Otter are found at the southwest end of Sinclair. Numerous streams in the area support salmon. Juvenile migration of coho and chum should be taking place. There are two mariculture facilities, one at Beans Pt, and one at Clam Bay on Rich Passage, which should be notified of the spill.  Movement of the slicks and wind direction should be watched closely tomorrow. Protective booming should be considered in sensitive areas if impacts seem likely. If the oil is heavier than #2, it will persist in the water and on land for longer periods.  USCG district 13."

The Patmos was carrying 828,300 barrels of Kirkuk crude oil while the Castillo de Montearagon was in ballast.  The Patmos caught fire and was grounded on the beach of Villagio Torre Faro, Sicily.  Firefighters subsequently towed the vessel off the beach to maneuver it for firefighting efforts.  The fire was extinguished on March 23, and the Patmos was brought to dock at Messina, Sicily. Approximately 5,300 barrels of Kirkuk crude oil spilled from the Patmos.  The majority of the spilled oil moved south through the Straits of Messina.  Most of the oil broke up in the variable currents of the strait, forming separate slicks that moved south at different rates.  Some of the oil initially released moved to the north due to tidal currents.  By March 23, most of the oil to the north had dissipated, but there was some sheen and mousse in the area.  As the oil moved south it incorporated garbage,  amounts of which typically exist in the waters east of Sicily.  A slick of about 750 barrels remained off the coast near Taormina in spite of onshore winds, for two days.  Small amounts of oil impacted the shore near Agnone Bagni, Capo Campolato, and Pozzillo.  The rest of the oil moved to the southeast away from Sicily and dissipated in the sea.

A cargo tank ruptured causing the release of 10,370 barrels of oil into the waterway, impacting a 12 mile section of the river and the surrounding shoreline. The weather at the time of the accident was clear with broken cloud coverage. Winds were NNW at 17-21 knots and the temperature was 68?F. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) was notified immediately. The On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) supervised all response and cleanup operations from September 28 to November 8, 1985. The Grand Eagle was freed from its grounding site at 0040, September 29 and was moved to the Sun Oil Company Refinery at Marcus Hook where the remaining cargo was offloaded.  The OSC authorized movement of the vessel with tug escort to Pennsylvania Shipbuilding in Chester, Pennsylvania to begin repairs on the damaged cargo tank.  Oil was boomed away from the vessel before beginning the moving operation, and a skimmer remained with the vessel to collect any oil lost during transit.  The vessel was moved without incident, and there was no significant loss of oil from the containment area.  USCG district 1.

    "description": "At 1130 on December 21, 1984, the United States Coast Guard was notified by a boater of an oil slick off Edmonds, Washington.  The actual spiller, estimated to have released 119 barrels, had not reported the incident.  Six suspect vessels had their oil \"fingerprinted\" by the Coast Guard to identify the responsible party.  Funds for the spill cleanup initially came from the USCG revolving oil pollution fund.  An overflight of the area was conducted at 1400.    The spill occurred during a time when thousands of migratory birds are overwintering in the area.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 of these birds were oiled as a result of the spill.  Many birds were treated at the South Whidbey Island Wildlife Clinic.  On December 23, personnel at a bird clinic established at Mukilteo's Olympic Junior High school began cleaning and feeding hundreds of oiled birds.  The birds were washed with dish washing detergent and tube-fed a mixture of Kaopectate, honey, high-protein baby cereal, activated charcoal, thirst-quencher, and poison antidote until the center received a high-protein feed donated by Ralston Purina's Woodinville, Washington plant.  Due to this donation and excellent handling, 60 percent of the 428 cleaned birds were last reported as surviving, as compared to an average survival rate of 20 percent for oiled birds. Manual cleanup of beaches was most prevalent where waters were too shallow for cleanup vessels.  In many of these narrow channels, the water was not deep enough to float boats carrying boom.  USCG district 13.  Keyword: Fingerprinting, manual removal.."

    "description": "On October 31, 1984, at 0324, an explosion occurred on board the Tank Vessel Puerto Rican outside the San Francisco Bay Entrance Channel.  The vessel was loaded with 91,984 barrels of lube oil and lube oil additives and 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel. Two crewmen and the pilot from the vessel were thrown into the water by the blast. The pilot and one crewman were recovered with serious burns.  One crewman remained missing and was presumed dead after an extensive search.  The explosion caused a relatively minor release of oil.  Flames from the initial and subsequent explosions shot as high as 1000 feet into the sky.  The fires on board the vessel were extinguished by late afternoon on November 1. Following the explosion, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) ordered the vessel towed out of the vicinity of San Francisco Bay.  The intent of the order was to minimize the potential for catastrophic environmental effect from a massive release of oil.  On the basis of trajectory forecasts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommended that the vessel be towed to the vicinity of a nearby ocean dumping site (37 32 N, 122 59 W).  This position is at the continental shelf break, 10 miles SE of the Farallon Islands.  The ongoing firefighting and cooling efforts were hampered as the vessel moved farther from shore.  The weather worsened on November 2, with seas as high as 16 feet and wind speeds up to 35 knots.  Salvage and inspection activities ceased for the day.  On November 3 at 0000, the Puerto Rican broke in two, releasing 25,000-35,000 barrels of its cargo and an undetermined amount of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel onboard.  The stern section sank one mile inside the boundary of the Point Reyes/Farallon Islands National Marine Sanctuary, taking most of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel with it. Keystone Shipping Co. of Philadelphia immediately assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.  They maintained responsibility throughout the response. From November 3-18, personnel from the USCG, NOAA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the State of California, and numerous contractors and volunteers were involved with the response.  On November 18, the forebody of the Puerto Rican was towed into the San Francisco Bay for repairs.  USCG district 11.

    "description": "On July 30, 1984 at 1236 the U.K. Tank Vessel Alvenus grounded in the Calcasieu River Bar Channel 11 miles southeast of Cameron, Louisiana.  The vessel suffered a structural failure which ruptured the hull near the No. 2 tanks.  The resulting spill of approximately 65,500 barrels of Venezuelan Merey and Pilon crude oil was carried in a westerly direction by wind and currents.  Offshore recovery was hampered by rough weather and the magnitude of the spill.  The water temperature was 80?F and winds were from the east and northeast 15-20 knots. The spill moved slowly westward, coming ashore near High Island, along the Bolivar Peninsula, and into Galveston Bay, Texas between Aug. 2-5.  Oil impacts were severe at Rollover Inlet and Crystal Beach, and on Aug. 4 more oil was pushed ashore further south along the Galveston Island coast.  The spill affected 90% of Galveston's West Beach, including 80% of the Galveston seawall and the associated rock groins and pilings.  Oil in the seawall area was a concern due to the oils smothering effect on marine organisms.  Organisms in this area were determined to be a minor part of the entire ecosystem and due to their transient nature were able to move to more suitable habitats.  Several dead crabs, rays, and fish were recovered along the seawall but could not be directly attributed to the spill.   Also oiled were marsh grass areas in East Bay (10-20 barrels) and 2 small lagoons.  Some oil which entered Galveston Channel did affect several small sand islands used as nesting sites for birds, although no affected birds or eggs were reported.  One oiled sea turtle was cleaned and released.  Tourism losses were estimated at $1 million per day. Commercial shrimp fishermen filed a suit for $10 million.  By October 1 the oiled beaches of Bolivar Peninsula and Galveston Island had been cleaned by the removal of oiled sand.  USCG district 8.

    "description": "At approximately 2315 on April 2, 1983, the M/V City of Greenville  with a tow of four tank barges struck the Illinois pier of the Poplar Street Bridge near downtown St. Louis, Missouri, on the Mississippi River.  Weather at the time was cloudy and overcast with light rain.  Visibility was 8 miles with winds gusting from the northwest to 25 miles per hour.  Crew error was the primary cause of the accident.  The barges, V882, V883, V884, and V885, were laden with a total of approximately 65,003 barrels of Montana Mix sour crude oil.  One of the barges exploded on impact and burst into flames.  As the fire continued to spread, the tow broke, setting three of the burning barges adrift down the river.  The tug and attached barge V885 were moved to the Peabody Coal facility at mile 179.2 for lightering and inspection. The three drifting barges caused extensive damage to facilities and other barges along the left descending bank on the Illinois side of the river.  While traveling downriver, one of the barges struck the Pillsbury Grain dock facility.  The fire spread to the dock, the grain elevator, and trees and bushes on the shoreline.  Three grain barges nearby caught fire as well.  A coal barge on the Missouri side of the river ignited from contact with one of the barges.  The Monsanto dock caught fire after being struck by one of the barges, and the impact ruptured a pipeline on a walkway, releasing approximately 100 pounds of monochlorobenzene into the river. Barge V884 suffered the most damage, both the barge and its discharged cargo on the river's surface were in flames.  After drifting downstream, V884 sank at mile 178.2 Upper Mississippi River (UMR) near the Cahokia Power Plant.  The barge continued to release its total cargo of 10,882 barrels of crude oil.  While burning out of control, barge V883 lodged bow first into the bank above the Cahokia Power Plant.  The fire spread uncontrollably onto the shore.  An hour later, V883 broke loose and continued drifting down the river, still engulfed in flames.  The M/V Katie  eventually grounded V883 by pushing it into the bank at the Pillsbury Facility.  The leading barge, V882, was forced into the Arsenal Island barge fleet area after being controlled by the M/V Gary D. Partridge.   The USCG Cutters Obion  and Cheyenne  fought the fire on V883 as well as the fire at the Phillips facility.  The cutters used all but two of their fire fighting foam cans.  To reduce the probability of reflash, the Cheyenne  applied a low-velocity water fog to V883.  The M/V Tom McConnel  used her propwash to keep burning oil on the water from reaching the Cheyenne  during firefighting operations.  By 1330 on April 3, the fires on the three escaped barges, the three grain barges, and the Pillsbury dock were out.   Valley Towing Service, Inc., the owners of the tug and barges, assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.  Three pollution cleanup sites were established at mile 177.6, 176.6, and 176.2 UMR.  A joint Regional Response Team (RRT) Region V and VII meeting was held in St. Louis on April 5, 1983.  USCG district 9.

    "description": "In 1983, the Nowruz Oil Field in the Persian Gulf, Iran, was involved in a number of oil pollution incidents.  On February 10, 1983, a tanker collided with a platform.  The platform developed a 45-degree tilt and had to be shut down.  Wave action and corrosion apparently caused the riser to collapse into the wellhead causing a spill of approximately 1,500 barrels per day.  The well was not capped because the field was in the middle of the Iran/Iraq war zone. This platform was attacked by Iraqi planes in March and the resulting slick caught fire.  This well was capped by the Iranians on September 18, 1983.  Eleven people were killed during the operation. In March 1983, a nearby platform was attacked with rockets by Iraqi helicopters.  The platform burned and spilled oil at an initial rate of approximately 5,000 barrels per day.  The rate slowed to about 1,500 barrels per day in the two years before the well was capped.  In May 1985, the fire was extinguished and the well was plugged with the assistance of divers.  Nine men died during these operations.  Approximately 733,000 barrels of oil spilled into the sea as a result of this incident.  It is estimated that the rate of oil leaking into the Persian Gulf in mid-May of 1983 was between 4,000 and 10,000 barrels per day due to more war-related activity or the collapse of burning platforms.   As a result of this incident, a cooperative program for large-scale trajectory modeling was developed between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Kuwait's Environment Protection Council under the Ministry of Public Health.

After the Olympic Glory moored at Barbours Cut, an inspection diver confirmed the presence of a 6 by 12 foot hole in the vessel's No. 6 port wing tank.  Approximately 20,000 barrels of Galeota crude were lost before the damaged tank could be lightered by portable pumps. First day response efforts focused on containment of the spilled product.  Crowley Environmental was contracted by the owners of the Olympic Glory to lead the cleanup effort.  Crowley subcontracted four other cleanup companies to aid in the operation.  Cleanup operations were divided into three separated zones.   Zone 1 covered the areas between Morgan's Point  and the Houston Yacht Club Marina.  Zone 2 covered the northern areas from Morgan's Point to the Exxon Refinery at Baytown, and included Upper San Jacinto Bay.  Zone 3 covered Barbours Cut.  Barbours Cut also served as the location of the cleanup operation's command post. Parties involved in the cleanup included the U.S. Coast Guard, Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife, Gulf Strike Team (GST), and Coast Guard Marine Safety Office, Houston.  Approximately 18,000 barrels of spilled product was successfully removed within 30 days.  The remaining 2,000 barrels were determined to be lost to natural dissipation.  USCG district 8.

    "description": "On March 7, 1980, the tanker Tanio, carrying 190,580 barrels of No. 6 fuel oil, broke in two off the coast of Brittany, France during a violent storm.  The master and seven crew members died as a result of the accident.  Approximately 98,955 barrels of oil spilled into the sea as a result of the breakup.  The bow section, which still contained 36,650 barrels of oil, sank in 300 feet of water.  Substantial amounts of oil continued to leak from the sunken bow until several small leaks in the bow were sealed in May.  The stern remained afloat and was towed to the port of Le Havre where its remaining 54,975 barrels of oil were offloaded. Strong northwest winds at the time of the incident moved the oil towards the Breton coast.  Due to the high viscosity of the oil and severe weather conditions, containment or dispersal at sea was impossible.  Because the spring tides in this region have an average tidal range of 26 feet, many areas along the coast could not be boomed effectively.  Consequently, the Breton coast (which had already received major oil impacts from the Torrey Canyon  spill in 1967 and the Amoco Cadiz  in 1978), was again severely oiled.  Approximately 45 percent of the Amoco Cadiz  spill area was affected by oil from the Tanio.  Approximately 125 miles of the coastline of the two Departments of Finistere and Cotes-du-Nord were oiled. Both Departments implemented the Plan Polmar, the French national oil spill contingency plan, due to the severity of the coastal oiling.  This enabled them to use the national army for cleanup operations.  Personnel from the Civil Defense organization, fire service, local governments, commercial contractors, and local farmers were also involved in the cleanup.  The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF) provided technical advice and monitored cleanup activities on behalf of the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Fund.  Cleanup operations in the two Departments varied due to differences in the severity of the pollution, nature of the shoreline, and the cleanup policies that were implemented.  Cleanup was completed and all beaches except St. Guirec were in use by early July.  Damages and costs incurred during cleanup exceeded $50 million.

The vessel initially spilled about 950 barrels of light oil and continued to leak for the duration of the incident.  An initial survey found nine of 12 tanks holed.  The ship's refrigeration system failed, releasing toxic levels of ammonia gas in the interior.   Access to the vessel was complicated by the rough seas and a 200-foot high cliff at the grounding site.  A makeshift, 90-foot highline was rigged from the base of the cliff to the ship.  The only alternative mode of access was by helicopter, which was not always available because of weather. The Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Office (MSO), Anchorage, the predesignated On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) for the spill, sent a representative to the site on November 9.  The owners of the vessel initially assumed responsibility for cleanup operations, but abandoned their responsibility on November 15, at which time the OSC took full control of the spill response.  Explosives were used to vent dangerous accumulations of ammonia gas on November 20, and also to finally destroy the vessel on November 22.  The response ended on December 5.  USCG district 17.

    "description": "On September 1, 1979, at 1412, the SS Chevron Hawaii exploded, burned, and sank while discharging cargo at the Deer Park Shell Oil Company terminal on the south side of the Houston ship channel.  The cargo of catalytic cracker feedstock and Santa Maria crude oil spilled into the sea as the fire burned for ten hours.   Lightning apparently ignited accumulated cargo vapors on the deck of the vessel.  None of the cargo tanks had been gas-freed.  The explosion was so powerful that a 5 foot by 7 foot hull fragment from the burning vessel penetrated the roof of a Shell Oil Company petroleum product shore tank located 600 feet inland from the vessel.  The contents of that shore tank, approximately 26,000 barrels of ethyl alcohol, ignited and burned as well.  As the fire spread into a nearby barge slip, four barges that were discharging cargo caught fire.  Three of these barges exploded and sank.  No significant amount of pollution came from any of these four barges.  Weather during the incident was warm and windy with heavy downpours and lightning.  The maximum reported wind gust for the day was 33 knots, at 1300. The fireboat M/V Captain F. L. Farnsworth, which had been moored 2.5 nautical miles from the terminal, was on-scene by 1430.  Four boats and 14 Coast Guard personnel assisted in fire fighting and lifesaving operations.  Two Coast Guard pollution team investigators from the Houston Port Safety Station were already on their way to the Shell terminal when the accident occurred.  They led the rescue of the burning vessel's boatswain from the forecastle.  Representatives from both the USCG Pacific and Gulf Strike Teams (PST and AST) monitored all phases of the cleanup.  Eighteen different cleanup companies were involved in the cleanup operations.  Since the spill occurred over a holiday weekend, it was difficult to recruit companies with equipment specifically needed for this spill.   One crew member and two radar repairmen aboard the SS Chevron Hawaii  were killed and 13 people were injured.  Even though six tugs were available within the barge slip, no attempt was made by the Shell Oil Company dockman or the tugboat operators to move any adjacent barges into the channel where they might have been safe from the fire.  Also, the dockman left the scene without activating the emergency cut-off switch.  This would have assured that any adjacent barges' cargo openings were properly secured.  Damages to the vessel, barges and facility exceeded $27,000,000.  USCG district 8.

The water depth at the wellhead site is about 50 m (164 feet). The IXTOC I was being drilled by the SEDCO 135, a semi-submersible platform on lease to Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). A loss of drilling mud circulation caused the blowout to occur. The oil and gas blowing out of the well ignited, causing the platform to catch fire. The burning platform collapsed into the wellhead area hindering any immediate attempts to control the blowout. PEMEX hired blowout control experts and other spill control experts including Red Adair, Martech International of Houston, and the Mexican diving company, Daivaz. The Martech response included 50 personnel on site, the remotely operated vehicle TREC, and the submersible Pioneer I. The TREC attempted to find a safe approach to the Blowout Preventer (BOP). The approach was complicated by poor visibility and debris on the seafloor including derrick wreckage and 3000 meters of drilling pipe. Divers were eventually able to reach and activate the BOP, but the pressure of the oil and gas caused the valves to begin rupturing. The BOP was reopened to prevent destroying it. Two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure from the well to allow response personnel to cap it. Norwegian experts were contracted to bring in skimming equipment and containment booms, and to begin cleanup of the spilled oil. The IXTOC I well continued to spill oil at a rate of 10,000 - 30,000 barrels per day until it was finally capped on March 23, 1980."

The damage was attributed to a fracture initiated by a weld defect and aggravated by wave impacts on the bow at low temperatures.  Although the tanker remained intact for some time after the initial hull plate failure, the bow and stern sections eventually separated and spilled an estimated 43,900 barrels of Bunker C into Cabot Strait.  The bow and stern sections drifted towards Canadian waters.  Approximately 50,000 barrels of oil remained in the bow section while 115,000 barrels remained in the stern. A wide band of mobile pack ice initially prevented the spilled oil from reaching the shoreline.  The Environmental Protection Service (EPS) immediately initiated the formation of the Regional Environmental Emergencies Team (REET) to provide assistance and advice to the Canadian Coast Guard's (CCG) On-Scene Commander (OSC).  REET members included the Atmospheric Environment Service, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, and Fisheries Management Service.  The REET was divided into three sections to deal with the three distinct problems: the bow, the stern, and the oil spill cleanup.  Under Lloyds Open Forum, the stern section was towed to Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, to recover remaining oil.  The bow section was towed to a deep water area 200 nautical miles off Nova Scotia and sunk by gunfire from the HMCS Margaree  on April 1, 1979.  Oil started coming ashore in April and two cleanup control centers were established at Low Point and Mulgrave, Nova Scotia.

The incident most likely occurred while the vessel was deballasting at the International Mineral and Chemical Corporation (IMC) Phosphate Terminal in Tampa, Florida.  The oil spread to East Bay, Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay and impacted 15 widely separated shorelines over a distance of approximately 20 miles. Personnel aboard the Howard Star failed to notify authorities of the discharge.  The  Coast Guard Marine Safety Office (MSO) Tampa was first notified by IMC on October 4 at 2025 that approximately 15 gallons of oil was in the water at the IMC terminal.  The Coast Guard discovered large quantities of floating oil streaming into Hillsborough Bay from the Port Sutton Canal.  The Environmental Coastal Pollution Cleanup Service (ECPCS) was notified of the spill and began mobilizing all available boom and cleanup equipment on October 5.  An additional cleanup contractor, Need-A-Diver, was contracted by the Coast Guard.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was activated at 1115 on October 5, and the USCG Gulf Strike Team was requested.   Because the entire transit system was affected, the port was closed to help contain the oil.  The MSO and cleanup contractors deployed four sections of boom to prevent the oil from spreading further into the surrounding bays.  By October 9, approximately 643 barrels of oil had been recovered by the contractors and the Coast Guard.  Since the populations of migratory waterfowl are low in October, there were only 14 known bird fatalities.  Several dead crabs were found along Whiskey Key and E.G.

    "description": "The U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a one-billion barrel store of imported crude oil.  The Hackberry facility is one of three active storage sites in the U.S.  The sites consist of caverns that are leached out of subterranean salt domes and are filled with oil by barges, tankers, and pipelines.  The oil contained in these domes is injected under pressure and, if any of the domes are vented, they will discharge until depressurized. At 1600 on September 21, a major oil spill and fire occurred at the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in West Hackberry, Louisiana.  At the time of the accident, the storage facility at Hackberry contained roughly 14.2 million barrel.  At the time of the accident, the storage facility at Hackberry contained roughly 14.2 million barrels of crude oil.  During the removal of a well string for maintenance, the plug used to cap the well was released, sending drilling mud and crude oil out the top of the string.  The low-flash point crude oil was ignited by nearby diesel engines and the resulting fire burned for five days.  The release of 72,000 barrels of oil was initially contained within a containment dike.  A breach of the dike the next day spilled 32,000 barrels of the oil into nearby Black Lake. Containment of the spill in the lake was accomplished with redundant tiers of boom.  After the fire was extinguished, skimmers were used to recover the contained oil.  Consistent winds and good weather greatly aided the recovery efforts.  Coast Guard personnel were involved in deploying boom and other recovery operations.  Cleanup operations were concluded on October 11, following an on-site inspection by the Regional Response Team (RRT).  USCG district 8.

This platform is 180 miles southwest of the Ekofisk oil field center in approximately 230 feet of water.  The blowout resulted in the first major oil release in the North Sea.  A red-brown mixture composed of oil and mud spurted up to 180 feet into the air above the offshore drilling rig.  The \"blowout preventer\" had apparently been placed upside down on the wellhead during an earlier maintenance procedure.  The 112 crew members on the platform were safely evacuated.  The blowout resulted in a continuous discharge of crude oil through an open pipe 20 meters above the sea surface.  At an estimated rate of 1170 barrels per hour, approximately 202,380 barrels of oil escaped before the well was finally capped 7 days later on April 30th.  Considerably less oil entered the water due to rapid evaporation.  As much as 30-40% of the escaping oil may have evaporated before of shortly after hitting the water.  A higher than average air temperature (75?F) and the formation of small oil droplets contributed to rapid evaporation rate. Four to six foot sea conditions and below average sea surface temperature conditions existed in the area of the platform at the time of the blowout. Red Adair was contracted by Phillips to assist in capping the blowout.  Although weather conditions and hazardous gas accumulations slowed capping efforts, the rig was capped on April 30.  The Norwegian State Pollution Control Board declared that no major ecological damage resulted from the spill.  Following an inspection tour on the day of the capping, two U.S. Coast Guard experts recommended against sending any oil-skimming equipment to Norway.  Weather and wave action during the following days were predicted to eliminate any visible slick.  Keyword: Blowout, drift cards, evaporation, water washing.."

The forward section of the barge began taking on water.  Due to darkness and heavy ice conditions, none of the 60,000 barrels of No. 6 oil aboard the Ethel H (II)  was observed to be leaking into the water at the time of the grounding. At 0255 February 5, the dispatcher reported oil leaking from the #1 starboard tank on the Ethel H (II).  Oil was observed both north and south of the vessel, but did not reach the shore due to 12 to 20 inches of shorebound ice.  By 1015, the Ethel H (II)  had shifted partially off Con Hook Rock and was in danger of sinking.  Tugs assisted to help prevent the barge from sinking.  Sea Land Environmental Engineering Co, contracted by McAllister Towing Co., and the USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST) arrived on-scene February 5.  After oil was pumped from submerged tanks, the barge's list was reduced to 15 degrees.  Once the barge was secured from sinking, Amerada Hess Corporation, owners of the Ethel H (II)  and McAllister Towing Co., refused responsibility for clean-up of any oil in the Hudson River.  The USCG took control of the cleanup, retaining Sea Land Environmental Engineering Company as the prime contractor.

The U.S. Coast Guard cutters Mallow and Jarvis were diverted to the scene for towing operations.  The sections were approximately 70 miles apart when the two cutters arrived at the stern section.  Since crew members were unable to board or tow the stern section due to rough seas, the Mallow continued on toward the bow section.  The stern section of the tanker presumably sank at approximately 26 55 N and 172 30 W.  By January 21, the bow section had only 25 feet of freeboard.

The vessel was loaded with 22,000 barrels of Bunker C at the time of the incident.  The apparent cause was a still-air situation that developed between the mid-ship house and the afterdeck house.  Vapors emitting from the cargo tank vents created a vapor cloud during ballasting.  These were ignited in the midship house and flashed back through the vent piping system.  The largest explosion took place in the number 10 center cargo tank.  The force of the explosion propelled the main deck over the cargo tanks into the air.  When the deck landed, it severed a 36-inch cargo line on top of the inshore isolation valve.  This severed line fed fuel to the fire until response personnel discovered and capped it on December 21.  Nine lives were lost as a result of the explosion.  Debris and oil scattered in all directions.  Approximately 400 boats in the vicinity were damaged by the fine mist of airborne oil, resulting in millions of dollars in property damage.  An estimated 30,000 barrels of oil were released into Los Angeles harbor from the ship and the severed pipeline. A U.S. Coast Guard boat and a Los Angeles City Fire Department boat arrived on-scene within five minutes of the explosion to assist in firefighting and rescue operations.  Pollution surveys were conducted after the fire was under control.  Initial reports concluded that much of the oil had burned off, but on December 19, underwater divers discovered a large quantity of oil on the bottom of the harbor.

    "description": "On May 12, 1976, the Tank Vessel Urquiola struck a submerged object while approaching the CoruÃ±a Oil Terminal at La CoruÃ±a, Spain.  The vessel began to leak cargo from the damaged bow section.  Due to the threat of explosion and fire, the Port Commandant ordered the Urquiola out of the harbor, away from the refinery and town of 200,000 inhabitants.  While being assisted out of the harbor by two tugs, the leaking vessel grounded again, further rupturing the bow tanks.  All of the crew, except for the captain and pilot, abandoned the ship when it began to list. Two hours later the vessel exploded, killing the captain.  Approximately 513,000 barrels of oil burned in the subsequent 16-hour fire.  Burning oil spread out from the vessel and was eventually extinguished by the cooling effect of the seawater.  Dense clouds of smoke were blown over the town of La CoruÃ±a.  A safety zone one mile in radius was established around the vessel after air monitors detected high levels of volatile gases.  Despite these precautions, a second explosion and fire rocked the vessel on the morning of May 14. Between May 12 and May 21, oil was estimated to be leaking at a rate of 2,200 barrels per day.  An estimated 180,000-220,000 barrels of the cargo polluted the Spanish coast.  On May 21, a smaller tanker and tug began lightering the Urquiola.  About 50,000 barrels of crude oil had been removed from the vessel by May 25, when lightering operations were halted by rough seas.  Ten to fifteen foot seas detached a large section of the bow.  On June 8, the stern section, containing an estimated 22,000 barrels of bunker fuel, was towed to a more protected area five miles to the west.  The stern was partially lightered before developing a crack in one of the tanks that resulted in further, limited leakage. Following the fire, the Spanish Navy and a fleet of commercial vessels applied over 2,000 tons of chemical dispersants to the Urquiola and surrounding waters in spite of resistance mounted by Spanish oceanographers.  Cleanup of the oiled shoreline was primarily accomplished by manual labor.  Skimmers and booms were used for water recovery with mixed results.

On the evening of February 4, a fire broke out in the engine room and the crew abandoned ship after unsuccessful attempts to extinguish the fire.  There were subsequent explosions on board the St. Peter and the fire continued to burn until February 5 or February 6, when the vessel sank in over 3,000 feet of water approximately 18 miles off Cabo Manglares, Colombia.  An Ecuadorian patrol boat returning to the site on February 6, found only an oil slick approximately one square mile in area. The sunken vessel released an initial burst of oil and then continued to slowly leak oil for some time.  The vessel was known to be leaking oil nine months after the sinking. The area affected by the spill covered a distance of over 200 miles, from Buenaventura, Colombia in the north to Punta Galera, Ecuador in the south.  The predominant shorelines in the area were sandy beaches, rocky shores, and estuarine areas with mangroves.  The heaviest oiling occurred in the area of Tumaco, Colombia and portions of the shoreline to the south, near the border of Ecuador.  Keyword: Fire, explosion, sinking.."

    "description": "On February 2, 1976, the petroleum transport barge STC-101, under tow by the Allied Towing Company Tug Falcon, partially sank during stormy weather in Chesapeake Bay approximately 3.5 miles off Smith Point Light.  The bow, protruding at a 30? angle, was approximately 30 to 40 feet out of the water while the stern rested on the bottom in approximately 105 feet of water.  The STC-101, loaded with 19,531 barrels of No. 6 Fuel Oil, was en-route from the AMOCO Refinery in Yorktown, Virginia, to the AMOCO Terminal in Baltimore at the time of the incident. Initially, only a small rainbow sheen, believed to be from deck machinery diesel and lube oil, was observed around the barge.  Clean Water Inc. was contracted by  Steuart Transportation, the barge owner, to stage pollution abatement equipment near the scene in the event of a spill during salvage operations.  An underwater survey of the barge on February 4 reported no oil leaking from the barge, however, oil patches and light sheen were reported in the surrounding area on February 5.  After the STC-101  was refloated on February 6 by the McLean Construction Company, the barge was intentionally grounded in Ingram Bay for dewatering operations.  Extensive damage to the port side was discovered.  Severe wind and weather conditions as well as poorly maintained and improperly secured cargo hatches may have contributed to the oil spillage. After the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office Hampton Roads received several reports of oil and birds washing up on surrounding shorelines, a Federal spill was declared on February 8.  On February 19, the AMOCO Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland, concluded that 5,959 barrels of oil were missing from the STC-101  barge. Beach and marsh areas of both the eastern and western shores of Chesapeake Bay were contaminated.  Large areas of dormant oiled marsh grasses were cut, leaving the root systems intact.  Virginia authorities estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 waterfowl were killed as a result of the spill. The bulk of the cleanup was completed by mid-March.  A final inspection on November 5 revealed little evidence of oil remaining in the affected areas.  USCG district 5.

The unmanned barge was loaded with 10,476 barrels of Bunker C and 2,403 barrels of diesel fuel oil when its tow line broke.  Attempts to free the vessel from the surf line failed.  Heavy surf pounded the vessel for over a week, eventually damaging all ten of the cargo tanks.  An estimated 7,679 barrels of Bunker C and diesel fuel were released during the next 30 days.  The barge was eventually lightered and beached. Oil released from the barge affected the beaches within the Ensenada de Boca Vieja.  Beaches at Punta Salinas and Levittown were the most heavily oiled.  The release of oil and subsequent cleanup operations occurred over a prolonged period, from December 9 to February 5, 1976.  Beach restoration in the form of sand replacement continued until April 2, 1976. Agencies involved in the response included the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), Gulf Strike Team (GST), U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage (NAVSUPSALV), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Commonwealth Department of Natural Resources (CDNR), Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board, and a host of commercial companies. Responsibility for the spill and cleanup was initially accepted by McAllister Towing.  On December 15, McAllister announced that it would no longer undertake or fund any further cleanup.

The collision occurred in the northeast traffic lane about 13 miles southeast of Dover, England.  One of the Olympic Alliance's cargo tanks was ruptured on impact resulting in the release of 14,000 barrels of Iranian crude oil.  The vessels were able to separate without assistance.  Visibility at the time of the collision was restricted by fog. Response equipment and personnel were mobilized immediately in accordance with the local contingency plans.  Vessels from a variety of sources were obtained for use in the application of dispersant.  The Kent County Counsel (KCC) Oil Pollution Officer activated the county's contingency plan and arranged for three fishing vessels to be equipped with dispersant spraying equipment.  The District Councils, Southern Water Authority, Nature Conservancy Council, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food Sea Fisheries Officer, as well as the coastal power stations were all alerted of the incident.  The forward base of operations was established at Dover. Much of the resulting slick was dispersed by natural forces and the application of 2,000 metric tons of the hydrocarbon, solvent-based dispersant BP 1100X.  Dispersant was applied in offshore and nearshore areas by surface vessel spraying.  Shoreline oiling was estimated at 2,200 barrels.  Sand and coarse gravel recreational beaches were oiled.  Response activities were concluded on November 18. The vessel was reported to have spilled an additional 73,000 barrels of oil between the site of the collision and Wilhelmshaven, West Germany.

The platform, designed for 12 oil wells, was unmanned because it was not yet in operation.  Approximately 7,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico after the vessel's port bow tank ruptured.  As flames engulfed the vessel, the master gave the order to abandon ship.  Forty of forty-six crew members were rescued, three charred bodies were found on board the ship August 17, and three crew members were lost at sea.  Weather at the time was mild with clear skies, wind at 10 knots out of the SW, and seas 1-2 feet.   Apparently, the ship was on autopilot with the radar turned off when the watch was relieved at midnight.  The charts that were in use were not up-to-date and showed no fixed structures on the ship's trackline.  When the radar was turned at 0030, nothing was visible.  At 0045, the radar revealed an object approximately 9 miles away on the starboard side of the vessel.  The Captain of the vessel claimed that he saw no navigational lights on the platform even though a Chevron spokesman said they were functioning properly.  The mate failed to plot the object.  At 0130, the port bow of the vessel struck the eastern side of the platform, opening up a gash 2 feet wide by the length of the bow tank.  The cargo ignited and the fire spread towards 15 drums of lube oil.  An emergency call was made and the ship was abandoned while fire and smoke engulfed the forward port section of the ship. Personnel working on other platforms in the area immediately responded to the accident.  Six utility boats surrounded the Globtik Sun within 30 minutes.  Two Coast Guard cutters and four aircraft arrived on-scene on August 15.  The charred vessel was towed by McAllister Towing to Galveston on August 18.  The Globtik Sun was later sold for scrap.

Oil started coming ashore on the beaches of Cabo Rojo, on the Bahia Sucia side, by the evening of the grounding.  Efforts to minimize beach impacts began on March 19.  These efforts involved booming, digging sumps, and pumping the collected oil into tank trucks.  On March 21, a substantial number of sea cucumbers, conchs, prawns, sea urchins, and polychaete annelids washed ashore.  Organisms were dying in the Thalassia beds off-shore as well. On March 23, the On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) activated the USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST).  Wind shifts had caused more shoreline oiling, and an increase in pumping capability was needed. After receiving training from the AST, Underwater Technics personnel manually cleaned beaches until April 26, when it was decided to leave the beaches alone since new sand was accumulating rapidly.

The bow of the T/V Mayo Lykes, penetrated the port bow of the barge at a 45-60 degree angle, and almost cut the barge in two.  Only the starboard outer skin of the barge held the vessel together. A large quantity of the 23,000 barrels of Louisiana crude oil and Bunker C spilled into the water upon impact.  Later estimates reported 10,000 barrels of pollutant spilled into the water.  Part of the spilled amount was released in the collision while the remainder leaked from the damaged tanks over the next several days.   Weather conditions at the time of the accident were extremely adverse.  Extensive fog, winds of 30-35 knots with 40 knot gusts, and seas of 3-4 feet hampered early containment attempts.  Since the owner and operator of the damaged barge denied any responsibility in cleaning up the oil, U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) personnel began cleanup operations using the Oil Spill Contingency Fund.  Brine Service Company was the primary cleanup contractor from March 12 until March 18 when Clean Channel Industries became the principal contractor, focusing on beach cleanup.  After March 12, the USCG took on a strictly supervisory and monitoring role while contract personnel performed the actual cleanup. Two days after the spill, the local Audubon Society, with USCG assistance, collected and cleaned approximately 400 oil soaked Eared Grebes.  The 320 surviving birds were released in an unpolluted area selected by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.  The Texas Department of Health, EPA Region 6, and Texas A&M University conducted ecological and pollutant studies in the affected area.  Preliminary results showed little long-term adverse effect to the environment.  Active cleanup continued until April 6 when the case officially closed, however cleaning on Atkinson and Bulkhead Reef Islands to the east of the Houston Ship Channel continued until the week of April 9.

    "description": "On June 22, 1972, 140,000-190,000 barrels of waste oil and sludge from Berks Associates oil reclamation plant escaped into the Schuylkill River at Douglassville, Pennsylvania.  The release resulted from heavy rains and flooding of the entire lagoon complex.  Twelve to eighteen inches of rainfall from Hurricane Agnes on June 21-22 raised the Schuylkill River 20 feet over its banks and flooded the waste oil lagoons.  Agnes proved to be the worst natural disaster in the U.S. at the time.  Two billion dollars in damage and 100 fatalities were attributed to the storm. The spilled oil was not sighted until June 23, due to the more pressing concerns of evacuation and property damage.  U.S. Coast Guard and Environmental Protection Agency personnel conducted an overflight of the area to assess the magnitude of the flood damage.  Black oil and several hundred drums containing hazardous chemicals were spread over much of the countryside along the Schuylkill River.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was assembled and an on-scene coordinator was assigned by the EPA.  The National Contingency Plan revolving fund was opened under the \"Act of God\" provision.  On June 28, the Coast Guard National Strike Force and personnel from the Division of Oil and Hazardous Materials (DOHM) were called. The rains stopped on June 30.  The top priorities at this point were to reduce the amount of oil leaching from the lagoons into the river and to protect the water intakes of downstream cities.  On July 4, three main contractors, Underwater Technics, Clean Water, and New England Pollution Control were tasked with cleaning up a 16 mile stretch of the Schuylkill River.  The spill area became a testing ground for clean-up methods.  The bulk of the cleanup was completed by early August.  By the conclusion of operations on September 30, the clean-up bill totaled $4.5 million.  USCG district 1.

The two vessels remained joined together while several damaged cargo tanks on the Oregon Standard began releasing bunker C fuel oil into San Francisco Bay.  Contributing factors to the incident were dense fog and darkness. Spill response started almost immediately.  A command post was established by 0445 by representatives from USCG District 12, the California Department of Fish and Game (CA DFG), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Although water borne movement of cleanup and containment equipment was hampered by the dense fog, containment booms were in place around both vessels by 0630.  The separation of the two vessels at 0900 resulted in an increased rate of spillage from theOregon Standard.  Concentrated efforts were directed at recovering oil still within the vessel's ruptured tanks. By the evening of January 18, Standard Oil had deployed numerous personnel and equipment along shoreline areas to recover the oil as it was beached.  By January 19, bird cleaning stations were established in several areas under the direction of CA DFG. Standard Oil was efficient in deploying cleanup resources well in advance of the oil movement due to good contingency planning.  The oil spill reached its maximum extent by January 20.  Skimming operations continued until January 27, at which time all beaches in the contaminated area were declared to be at least 95% clean.  Small cleanup crews patrolled oiled beach areas until March 12, picking up small globs of oil and straw.  Cleanup in the rocky out croppings of Rocky Point was completed by March 19.

    "description": "On December 1, 1970, Shell Oil Co. Platform 26 exploded and caught fire.  The platform included 22 production wells with a capacity of 15,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  The flames from the burning platform blazed 400 feet into the air.  The 21-B well, with a 424-barrel per day capacity, ruptured 12 feet above the water.  By December 3, the service crane had collapsed towards the center of the platform at a 60? angle.  Burning oil covered the surface of the water within 50 feet of the platform.  By December 7, well No. 21-B was contributing to 30-50 percent of the fire.  Shifting winds, fog and rough seas slowed response efforts at times. Holes were shot into the tubing of some of the wells to determine whether oil was still being produced.  On January 12, Shell Oil Co. personnel perforated a relief well in an attempt to contain the flow.  On January 20, eight of the wells remained on fire.  Corexit 7664 dispersant was applied to the slick at a rate of 3 barrels per hour. Response operations began moderating on March 1.  A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were released from the scene.  Shell Oil Co. officials were required to submit daily pollution reports to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), New Orleans, in advance of any operations that may have increased pollution.   Drilling, capping, and pumping of the wells continued throughout April.  By April 16, the estimated rate of release was 20 barrels per day.  The slick was reportedly staying within a 6-mile radius of the platform, with sheen extending to 12 miles.  The slick was reduced to sheen during the following months as pumping and capping operations continued. Beach surveys were conducted by personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell Oil Co., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, and other local observers.  The only shoreline oiling that resulted from the incident was  between Caminada Pass and Bay Champagne.  The case was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard on May 17, 1971.  The explosion and subsequent fire killed four people and seriously burned 37 others.  USCG district 8.  "

The Pacific Glory caught fire, and was taken under tow as firefighting tugs tried to control the fire.  Explosions ruptured a starboard tank, and led to the flooding of the engine space.  The next day, the tanker began to settle and eventually touched bottom at a point four miles from the shore.  The Allegro continued on from the collision site under her own power.  The initial leak stopped soon after the collision, but as explosions occurred on the Pacific Glory additional leaks started from a starboard tank.  The tank contained 35,400 barrels of Nigerian crude oil.  Some of the oil burned, but approximately 24,780 barrels of oil spilled from the tank, forming three slicks.  Very little oil came ashore, but some oil impacted Brighton and Selsey. "

    "description": "On January 28, 1969, the Union Oil Company well number 21 under Platform A, located 5.5 miles southeast of Santa Barbara, California, in the Dos Cuadras field, experienced a blowout while drill bits were being changed.  A massive mixture of oil, gas, and drilling mud roared up the drill casing and spewed out onto the platform.  Well A-21 was capped on February 7 with 13,000 barrels of heavy drilling mud.  Oil continued to vent from natural faults several hundred yards from the platform, in tract 4042 between the coast and a chain of islands.  The faults released a total of 100,000 barrels of oil until December 1969.    A record-breaking storm immediately before the incident contributed to the large amount of oiled debris that needed to be collected as part of the spill response.  On February 2, the National Pollution Contingency Plan, instituted by President Johnson in 1968, went into effect for the first time.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Administration was on-scene to monitor the well-killing process and cleanup.  Red Adair was brought in to provide expertise capping the well.  To aid in predicting the slick movement, the National Weather Service set up a local station to monitor winds and tides.  Weather during the cleanup was moderate except for a storm on February 4 and 5 that temporarily halted cleanup by damaging booms that were protecting harbors and marinas.   The majority of the cleanup was completed within 45 days.  Commercial fishing was completely closed in the area from February until April.  Although the environmental effects of the spill were relatively minimal, economic effects were extensive due to loss of fishing income, loss of recreational facilities, and damage to personal property.

    "description": "The Tampico Maru  (henceforth Tampico) left Los Angeles Harbor in latter March 1957, bound for Japan, and loaded with dark diesel oil supplied by Union Oil of California (now known as Unocal).  The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System.   Welding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.  The crew and passengers were able to disembark and reach shore safely in the lee of the hull.    A portion of the oil cargo was liberated at the time of grounding.  The remainder escaped over the next 6-9 months as the ship was slowly torn asunder by pounding surf.   The location was in a remote section of coastline so no countermeasures were taken to remove a portion of the cargo or lessen ensuing pollution of the shore.  A few shacks scattered along the coast here housed native fishermen and their families.  The site was accessible by an extremely rough road, best negotiated by 4-wheel drive vehicles.  The main paved highway ran about 10-20 miles inland and the trip from there  to the study site required 2-3 hours.  Keyword: accidental grounding, diesel oil, mixing by surf."
